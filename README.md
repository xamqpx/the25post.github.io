# The 25 Post

The official GitHub repository for The 25 Post.
The 25 Post site is a static website constructed with HTML/CSS/JS.

## Basic topology:
- **root** folder has .ttf font files and home/navbar .html pages. (index and index.html are duplicates, created in order to bypass GitHub Pages requiring an index.html for setup.)
- **archives** folder has all media, and **articles** (COMMENTARY .html's), **pieces** (NON / FICTION .html's), and **meta** (META .html's) folders.
