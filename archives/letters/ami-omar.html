                    <inline class="padded-dropcap">A</inline>mitai Segev definitely has a thing for maids. The Polaroid on the back of his iPhone, where he&rsquo;s posing with a server at the Asayoru Maid Caf√© in Los Angeles, along with a few friends, is a glaring indication of the fact. When pressed, he will most likely deny it. He will tell you, however, and with great pride, that he is somewhat of an urban legend at Asayoru. They know him by name; he's gone with friends at least a dozen times, even for his twenty-first birthday (which is when the Polaroid was taken). At some point, he volunteered &mdash; probably boozed out of his mind on less than half a pint, the fucking lightweight &mdash; to dance in front of the whole restaurant for one of their performances. By some miracle, it went well. <q>They still talk about you at the cafe sometimes,</q> his friend, Kyle Voong, told him over text in November. <q>You&rsquo;re an icon.</q>
                </p>

                    He comes across as an extrovert, but I&rsquo;ve always seen him as otherwise. He is certainly loud at times, and he seems to feed off the energies of other people; but the silences in between tend to be louder, and he seems to treat them as sacred. I remember the one thing that consistently turned him off, as he told me back when he had the time and energy to (try to) date women, was when they had far too much energy. In some ways I found it cathartic, to see someone who used to drain all of my energy finally feel what it was like to be drained.

                <p>
                    The details of how I first met Amitai are hazy. It was August of last year; I had just moved in to start my freshman year at <small>U.S.C.</small>, despite classes being mostly remote (in-person instruction wouldn&rsquo;t start until the next term), and the only people I at least sort of knew were my roommates, a few people I&rsquo;d met at orientation, and a rowdy bunch of upperclassmen I&rsquo;d met by chance on a Discord server.
                </p>
                <p style="margin: 0;">
                    Two nights before the first day of classes, the university hosted a huge party spanning the two lawns at the <small>U.S.C.</small> Village, the rest of it jam-packed with hundreds of people in hours-long lines and even more freshmen wandering around confused. Some of us on the Discord server had arranged to meet amidst the chaos. I had no idea what anyone looked like, but somehow I made my way to the spot and Amitai noticed me immediately. The only thing I remember from that night, regrettably, is him shouting, <q><small>JON TWENTY-FIVE FROM USCORD???</small></q> at the top of his lungs. In that instant I considered turning back and running away; but I&rsquo;m glad I stayed.
                </p>

                <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1102672044275028009/1102675839562285188/IMG_2176.jpg" id="floating-image" style="float:right;padding-right:0;">

                <p>
                    It&rsquo;s become a bit of a running joke that we&rsquo;ve run out of things to say, since we hang out so often, and neither of us really feel like starting the conversation; we&rsquo;ll break the silence scrolling through TikToks with the most insufferable icebreaker questions like, <q>What&rsquo;s your major?</q>  or <q>So you come here often?,</q>  punctuated with his signature hearty laugh. (Nowadays, it&rsquo;s evolved into a shorthand of just saying &ldquo;So, uh...&rdquo; and letting the silence do the rest of the work.) There was never a man alive on this earth for whom the word <q>guffaw</q> could not be more appropriate; and it has a certain rasp to it that makes it all the more contagious. 
                </p>
                
                <p>Amitai, I can&rsquo;t possibly put into words how much you mean to me. Your company, your advice, your Larry David-esque standup routines, our circular conversations, our collaborative Spotify playlists, our harpings about women &#9749; and Shohei Ohtani, our awkward handshakes, our car rides, our trips to everywhere and nowhere &mdash; all have been my lifeblood in my two years here at USC. It is you who showed me the best places around town and shaped my perception of L.A., the city of angels: Griffith Observatory, Colorado Street Bridge, Little Tokyo, the H, Menya Tigre, millet crepe, CoCo ICHIBANYA. I will always remember the nights we went to see the L.A. Philharmonic, and beabadoobee, and 100gecs, and the other nights when we got McDonald's and drove around town listening to <q>Sparks</q> by Coldplay.</p>

                <p>I can&rsquo;t imagine USC without you. I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;ll even do when you graduate, but I know we can figure something out.</p>

                <p>I love you, Amitai. Thank you for being my friend. &#9632;</p>

                <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">O</inline>mar Uraimov is, in short, an enigma. He makes noises which are unprompted and entirely incomprehensible, even to himself. He spreads himself out like a starfish for no apparent reason than to foster a brooding self-satisfaction. He walks and talks like a human rendition of GPT-4, or, alternatively, a Texan boomer that tells kids to get off his lawn. More bewildering still &mdash; for some reason as yet unknown, he is the only person in a 200-mile radius who swears by the Houston Rockets.</p>

                <p>A couple years ago now, I told Omar that he was a role model for healthy masculinity. I forget the exact context, and how he even responded to that, but to this day I still hold that to be true. He is confident but unafraid to let himself go. He is strong but unexpectedly tender, when he needs to be. In a way, I have always aspired to be Omar; I am, in part, the man I am today because of him, and even as he leaves, I hope I can follow the example that he has set.</p>

                <p>Forever seared into my memory is this one night, in the beginning of May: Amitai and I were eating dinner at their apartment, and Omar trudged into the living room with an inscrutable glaze over his eyes.</p>

                <p><q>Guys,</q> he said, in his usual monotone. <q>I am a celebrity in Kyrgyzstan.</q></p>

                <p>He could only explain himself after we laughed for three minutes straight. Someone &mdash; probably an overenthusiastic family member &mdash; had caught wind of the game he was making, inspired by, and named after, the Kyrgyz legend Manas. Leaked video of the game made it to Kyrgyz local news, and his family started sending him screenshots of social media posts calling him the <q>son of Kyrgyzstan</q> and a hero comparable to <q>Alexander the Macedonian.</q> Ami and I could only stare at him in disbelief. He stared back, equally confused.</p>

                <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1102672044275028009/1102673067131535450/IMG_0204.jpg" id="floating-image" style="float:right; padding-right: 0;">

                <p>Then, of course, we did the only logical thing friends could do: embrace it wholesale. Our groupchat name proudly bears the Kyrgyz flag, and my contact for Omar is <q>omar uraimov, son of kyrgyzstan.</q></p>

                <p>Omar, I truly believe you are destined for great things. I can only await the day you will appear on the news here in the U.S., too, as anchors and pundits praise your myriad accomplishments. You will certainly hate it, but I believe it is only what you deserve: the best.</p>

                <p>Goodbye, Omar. Thanks for being my friend. See you around. &#9632;</p>

                <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">C</inline>ongrats on graduating and completing <q>Manas,</q> too, Omar! It honestly feels like it&rsquo;s been ages since we first met in the Century living room, where we all stood around awkwardly since we didn&rsquo;t know each other yet; and now I get to celebrate with you on completing college! One of my very first memories of you was when we ditched the Discord group to grab HoneyBird for dinner with Gloria. I still remember learning about your major and how you were really interested in themed entertainment. It was the first glimpse I had of your passion towards your work and interests and it&rsquo;s something I look up to you for. From all our Century talks to hanging out for board game nights, I&rsquo;m really glad to have you as a friend and I know you&rsquo;ll do incredible things once you leave USC. Can&rsquo;t wait to see what&rsquo;ll happen in the next chapter of your life! (P.S. Learn how to drive so we can go places next year pls &lt;3) &#9632;</p>

                <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">A</inline>mi: Congrats on finally freeing yourself from being a Marshall snake! It&rsquo;s kinda funny; I don&rsquo;t actually remember the first time we ever met, but within a blink of an eye, I can say that we&rsquo;ve created a great friendship through the mutual trauma bonding of all our BUAD classes &#128553;. But to be actually serious, I&rsquo;ve genuinely really appreciated having you as a friend here at USC. I&rsquo;m really glad we&rsquo;ve been able to bond more, especially during this last semester. It&rsquo;s been nice being able to chat about the randomest of things or gossip about people we see at the gym. I wish you the very best for everything that you will accomplish after leaving USC! I have no worries that you&rsquo;ll do amazing in your future endeavors. Let&rsquo;s do more Dulce runs and gym workouts next year! &#9632;</p>

                <p>Dear Amitai,</p>

                <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">W</inline>ow. I feel like I blinked and you&rsquo;re graduating now, going off into the world to the promised land &mdash; KPMG. Hahah jk. But sincerely, you have made my college experience at USC so fun and full of life, and that goes to show the kind of person you are: someone who inspires people with happiness. The first time we met seems very much like the beginning of a joke (like the start of a Family Guy episode, or whatever). We interacted on the infamous [REDACTED], and then met up in person with Chris and I &mdash; when you promptly decided to ditch us to go to Yogurtland. That was the beginning of a wild ride. Whenever I took a Marshall class with you, I knew I&rsquo;d always have a good time, because you would be reliable and dependable as ever and make classes fun with your presence. Sometimes we&rsquo;d troll on Discord, sometimes we&rsquo;d mald over chess (or Connect4), sometimes we&rsquo;d seriously listen and take group notes, and sometimes we would struggle during hour long study sessions trying to make up for too much tomfoolery in the classroom. Taking class with you has always been a pleasure; taking class with you made even the most mundane days entertaining. Let&rsquo;s even reflect on our life in ICC (the world&rsquo;s best consulting club in the world, surely). Even if we did nothing on that hell TSM project, it was still fun (pretending) to lead a team with you. Xia Enterprises and Segev LCC will always be a great partnership. </p>

                <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1102672044275028009/1102674335874945114/IMG_0369.jpg" style="float:left;padding-left:0" id="floating-image">

                <p>And outside of just the Marshall world, all the adventures you initiated and took So True on were so much fun. You brought me out of my comfort zone when I would have otherwise decided to rot at home, and I cannot thank you enough for that. Looking through my camera roll, I&rsquo;m starting to feel nostalgic. The Ditto dance at UCLA, our unintentionally matching Converse shoes, the epic chess match at Din Tai Fung, the mini-fight during Jeopardy  &gt;:&lpar;, the scenic walks at the Arboretum, the silly photos in San Diego &mdash; my life would feel incredibly empty without your friendship and the warmth you bring that infects us all.</p>   

                <p>I know a lot of our friendship has been formed on the basis of roasting each other, but I think what I admire most about you is how you always try to be a good person. You&rsquo;re there for people when they need you. You help people, even if they don&rsquo;t ask for it. You bring people out of their shells and make them smile. This is going to sound cheesy, but I&rsquo;m so grateful to have a friend like you. And I&rsquo;m so proud of your growth and the things you&rsquo;ve achieved that surely did not come easily. I look forward to our board game cafe enterprise with Omar and you (I will bring the cat) and for our KPMG x EYP happy hours. You best believe I will teams message you through my workday once I start full-time.</p>

                <p>Best, Audrey &#9632;</p>

                <p>Hello <s>Omar</s> Son of Kyrgyzstan,</p>

                <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">H</inline>oly holy shit. You are such a legend and a unit for real. I know we might not talk or hang out as much as other members of so true might, but you seriously are such an inspiration. I really admire your resilience and your ability to pursue the dreams you want without any hesitation or doubt. It&rsquo;s really impressive seeing how throughout the years I&rsquo;ve known you, you ideated Manas and then fully implemented it as a real game. You might not know this, but you&rsquo;ve had more influence on me than you might think. I&rsquo;m not sure when this happened, but maybe during my sophomore year, I ranted on Discord about how I was feeling unfulfilled. I don&rsquo;t remember the specifics of the conversation, but you told me -- why not? Why can&rsquo;t you do it? You can do it. No matter what, you have had this faith and belief in everyone to accomplish their dreams. Not only do you believe in everyone and encourage people to be the best people they can be, you lead by example as well. Everything you do, you do well. For things you love, you really see them through to the end. I&rsquo;ve always found that incredibly admirable.</p>

                <p>Outside of all that, you make board game nights board game nights. I remember Gloria talking about how in her class, someone proposed that there should be a government subsidy for all game explainers. You, sir, deserve a government subsidy for introducing us to all these amazing games and explaining them so well and keeping these game nights alive that have been some of my happiest moments at USC. Even if you&rsquo;ll defeat us at Jeopardy and Murder Trivia Party until the end of time, it&rsquo;s an honor to be able to play with a Quizbowl champion.</p>

                <p>Til next time, Audrey &#9632;</p>

                <p>Ami,</p>

                <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">C</inline>ongratulations on surviving college! From standing at UBC four years ago to standing on the graduation podium, you have made the most of USC. I always admired how you went out of your way to make us happy. You did so in your classes, and I won&rsquo;t forget how your face lit up as you announced at game night that you made your class laugh. Our intense Splendor games helped me decompress when I was at my lowest. It was always a pleasure to hear your stories about your family and friends because they highlighted your positivity, your resiliency, and your deep compassion for those you trust. Those are rare qualities, and I deeply respect you for them.</p>

                <p>I have to say I&rsquo;m a little sad. When you leave, there will be no one on campus to chant the lyrics of Jewish hymns with me, appreciate abstract memes, or butcher the lyrics to Dramaturgy. No matter the venue &mdash; San Diego, Hollywood Bowl, 1234 W 37th Pl &mdash; hanging out with you was always an adventure, and these adventures I will miss.</p>

                <p>Thank you for being part of my own college journey. I can&rsquo;t wait to see the things you achieve, the places you go, and the people you meet. Take the world by storm.</p>

                <p>One day I will beat you in Smash Ultimate >:&rpar;</p>

                <p>Omar,</p>

                <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">C</inline>ongratulations on surviving college and completing <q>Manas</q>! It seems like forever since we were hanging out at Century, with the smiley face and the stuffed uterus. I always appreciated your goofiness, and it was always extremely fun to hang out and play board games with you. I don&rsquo;t know when or how our tradition of just staring and pointing at each other on campus started, but it&rsquo;s one of those little parts of the USC experience that I will miss when you graduate.</p>

                <p>I will also miss our rare but deep conversations on the meaning of leadership. Your creative drive, steadfast vision, and your fine-tuned control over your projects was extremely inspirational to me, especially when I was struggling to rein in my club-that-must-not-be-named. Moreover, you were always positive and introspective, despite your massive workload. During parts of the school year that seemed to just drag on, your positive energy and love of life was infectious. I know you will continue to cherish it, just as we have.</p>

                <p>Thank you for being a part of my own college story. You undoubtedly have a bright future, and that definitely goes without saying. I can&rsquo;t wait to play video games in the future and see on the screen, Produced by Omar Uraimov. Let&rsquo;s still eat Kyrgyz food sometime too :&rpar;</p>

I have lived so much of my college life with you that it&rsquo;s honestly kind of fucking absurd the different versions and eras of each other that we&rsquo;ve known. From calls on D*scord, to the 1576th trip to Sawtelle, to celebrating your 21st at both Round One AND the fucking maid cafe, I can&rsquo;t describe to you properly in words how fucking awesome it is to have been able to see you become the person that you are today. Bit by bit, overcoming each hardship and event and becoming a bit more confident, a bit more comfortable, and a bit more genuinely happy with each big and small victory. I cannot think of another person that I&rsquo;d rather lie to people at CalTech, or watch hour long dissertations on Sewerslvt, or find matching anime hoodies with. Sincerely, I consider myself eternally lucky and grateful to have you in my life, and I&rsquo;m so pumped to see what&rsquo;s in store for you as you continue (whether that&rsquo;s a nice girl with hobbies, a business-stress induced heart attack, or a nice little snack :3). I think you&rsquo;re so fucking cool. *Kisses forehead through screen* *Tucks you in* *Feeds you a little drink* *Puts on lullaby and checks bottom of your bed for monsters before turning off the light and closing the door* Okay goodnight &lt;3</p>

You have worked so hard these past couple years, not just academically but in every aspect. I&rsquo;m very proud of the person you are now and am excited to see how much more you will grow! I&rsquo;m really glad we became closer friends this year and I wish I came out of my shell earlier. We would&rsquo;ve had so many more memories!!!!</p>
                <p>It&rsquo;s really fun talking to you. We have such a broad range of conversations and all of them make me very happy. Like music, anime, cats, lala land, chess, and so much more.

                <p>Thank you for being a wonderful friend. I am sure you will be amazing at all the things you do. Good luck with your future endeavors!

                <p>Hello Omar,</p>

                <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">C</inline>ongratulations on graduating! I know that you&rsquo;ve worked really hard to get here. I&rsquo;m glad that everything went well. Plus, you&rsquo;re finally free from USC. By this point, you are releasing Manas (or maybe it has released already by the time you get this?), and maybe I&rsquo;ll buy it and play it if I have time but if not I&rsquo;ll at least keep an eye on it and watch playthroughs and stuff. I know how much the game means to you. I read the article on it and I think your inspiration for it is beautiful.</p>

                <p>I know we didn&rsquo;t talk that much, but in the short bit that I did talk to you and spend time with you it was fun. I feel like we would have gotten along pretty well since you know a lot about video games and basketball. While I definitely don&rsquo;t think I love basketball as much, I do think I love video games as much as you do. Maybe we can talk about it sometime.</p>

                <p>One day I&rsquo;ll see your name somewhere on a triple-A title, and I&rsquo;ll be able to say &ldquo;I know that guy&rdquo;. I wonder if that&rsquo;s what you are hoping to do in the future, or if you&rsquo;d rather do something else. Regardless, I think the career that you chose is amazing, and I hope that you have a ton of fun doing it. A lot of kids grow up wanting to design video games, so the fact that you put in the effort to actually go out and do it is amazing.</p>

                <p>So keep making games. I know that you&rsquo;ll do your best when you make them. Even if some dickheads rag on your game, as long as you put your heart into it, it will have been worth it. (I know how shitty gam*rs can be in their reviews. Don&rsquo;t let them get you down)</p>

                <p>Sincerely,</p>

                <p>Shawn &#9632; </p>

                <p>Hello Amitai,</p>

                <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">C</inline>ongratulations on graduating!</p>

                <p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot I want to say to you but I&rsquo;m going to have a hard time getting the words onto paper, so it might come out as a lot of word vomit. Or maybe I won&rsquo;t be able to put it down on paper at all. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

                <p>The first conversation we had together was, I believe, about music. I can&rsquo;t remember exactly what musician it was but I was just happy to have somebody to talk to. I think it might&rsquo;ve been Panchiko. I didn&rsquo;t really think that I&rsquo;d become such good friends with somebody who I only knew by a small icon on a computer screen.</p>

                <p>I very much cherish the time that we spent together in college. It&rsquo;s weird, because when we&rsquo;re together I still feel like a freshman and you still feel like a sophomore. And it&rsquo;s all the more strange when I realize that we are much older and we&rsquo;ve exchanged being dumbass teenagers for dumbass adults.</p>

                <p>We can talk about clothes, music, basketball, memories, food. Anything, really. We talk about literally anything with one another, and bitch and complain about anything, too. I think we both get along so well because we grew up on the internet. I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way. I just like hanging out with you. Sitting in your car and going to do whatever - thrifting, getting food, just walking around campus, watching anime.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;m sad you're graduating, and it&rsquo;s something I think about a lot. I suppose that&rsquo;s normal. I wish I hung out with you more. I guess there&rsquo;s always time in the future, but it&rsquo;s different when you start working, and it&rsquo;ll be different after I start working, too.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;m proud of you, and I wish you the best.</p>

                <p>Sincerely,</p>

                <p>Shawn &#9632;</p>

                <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">Y</inline>ou&rsquo;ve been a right jolly fellow for the past two years that I&rsquo;ve gotten to know you, starting from when I thought your name was a username you made up on Discord, and it has been a pleasure to watch you grow as a person from someone who was less sure of himself to someone who is tangibly more self-confident. My favorite part of any anime I watch is learning what makes characters or people tick, and I&rsquo;ve loved learning about your personal life philosophies and seeing you define what happiness means to you.  We definitely gotta hit the maid cafe another time and see Sae, and keep exploring LA restaurants in the Ami-mobile &mdash; the pastrami you recommended sounds absolutely bomb. I also appreciate your memes on Insta, even if I take several business days to respond to them. You have a lot of positive qualities that shine through when people get to know you, so trust in yourself and keep on spreading that positivity after college. You bring light and spark joy wherever you go, and I know that you&rsquo;re going to do well after graduation. Congratulations on graduating, and we&rsquo;ll miss you lots!!</p>

                <p>To the son of Kyrgyzstan,</p>

                <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">T</inline>here&rsquo;s just so much to say that I can&rsquo;t put it into words here. Getting life advice from you, learning how to play Carcassonne at game nights, watching you reach greater heights during college has been an absolutely beautiful experience that I&rsquo;m glad I could be a part of. Thank you so much for introducing me to the world of the NBA, and for guiding me through my first season as a fantasy manager. It&rsquo;s been unbelievable to see you dream big with Manas, and then execute it successfully. I&rsquo;ve always felt like you know exactly where you want to be, and I really admire that self-confidence and ability to just know who you are and what you can do, which is something I&rsquo;ve realized is so important to have recently and something that I&rsquo;m still coming to grasps with. You filled the role of big brother of the friend group because of your nuggets of wisdom and calm demeanor, and I&rsquo;ll miss you dearly when you graduate. Congratulations on your new game, and I can&rsquo;t wait to play it!  Never lose sight of what&rsquo;s important to you, and you&rsquo;ll continue to do great things. Come back and visit us often!</p>

                <p>P.S. If I end up being a GI doctor, your first 3 appointments are on the house.</p>

                <p>With love from your fellow Houstonian, Eddie &#9632;</p>

Your emotional maturity and goofiness combination is actually really refreshing and I hope you continue to stay true to yourself.</p>

                <p>And AHHH the memories!! I&rsquo;m going to miss trying to scare you every time you played Roblox in your room, and your immaculate car playlist taste (I won&rsquo;t miss the distracted driving though!!!!!! jkjk) Thank you for taking us on such memorable adventures over these past two years. I&rsquo;m so glad that so many of the memories I&rsquo;ve made of LA have been with you, whether it is the Huntington, the Arboretum, Sawtelle, the Santa Anita Mall, Santa Monica, and even San Diego! And that Super Bowl party was so iconic. Thank you for commissioning me and being my first actual (!!) client. It honestly meant so much :D</p>

                <p>I still remember our initial meeting like it was yesterday. Walking around the walls of Century to see you in the courtyard, walking around (lost af LOL), visiting you when you realized you were allergic to crab, and then ditching the Village Catan players to eat Honeybird with Queenie&#8230; I&rsquo;m so glad we were able to make such amazing memories. Our trips to Monterey, Santa Barbara, Solvang&#8230; All of these times were so precious to me and I can&rsquo;t believe I was so lucky to have found you.

                <p>And how you&rsquo;ve grown! From watching you become such a dragon boat ICON team daddy, to (maybe?) warming up to ideas of cats, to becoming a bird ID master, to watching the growth of Manas from a little idea to the massive (un)REAL project that is today, I can&rsquo;t believe how strong you are. So #Leo and #GoldDragon of you, but also how very Omar of you. You are an absolute trailblazer and I admire you SO MUCH. You are so, so genuine and your heart is so big. You put your 1000% into everything you do, and that&rsquo;s why I know with absolute certainty that you will achieve anything and everything you want, and so much more. One day I&rsquo;m sure there will be a studio with your name on it. And I&rsquo;m eagerly awaiting the Omi (Omar x Ami) epic board game caf&eacute; collaboration that will outshine even The Dragon and The Meeple. There&rsquo;s so much more I want to write but this is in a shared folder and i&rsquo;M SHY &#128073;&#128072; Thank you for bringing such joy and love to my time at USC.</p>

                <p>Omar, I will always treasure the moments we&rsquo;ve shared over the past two years. Meeting you and all of your talent and your silliness has been one of the best things that has happened&ndash; for that, I am eternally grateful for sharing this piece of your life with me.</p>
