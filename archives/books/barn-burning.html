                    <inline class="padded-dropcap">I</inline> met her three
                    years ago at a friend's wedding reception, here in Tokyo,
                    and we got to know each other. There was nearly a dozen
                    years' age difference between us, she being twenty and I
                    thirty one. Not that it mattered much. I had a lot else on
                    my mind then, and didn't have time to worry about things
                    like age. Plus, I was married, but that didn’t seem to
                    bother her either.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She was studying with a famous mime, and working as an
                    advertising model to make ends meet. But she usually found
                    it too much trouble to go out on the modeling assignments
                    she was given, so her income didn't amount to much. What it
                    didn't cover, her boyfriends made up. Of course, I don't
                    know for sure. But things she said, seemed to hint at that
                    kind of arrangement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I mentioned, when I first met her she told me she was
                    studying mime. One night, we were out at a bar, and she
                    showed me the Tangerine Peeling. As the name says, it
                    involves peeling a tangerine. On her left was a bowl piled
                    high with tangerines; on her right, a bowl for the peels. At
                    least that was the idea. Actually, there wasn't anything
                    there at all. She'd take an imaginary tangerine in her hand,
                    slowly peel it, put one section in her mouth, and spit out
                    the seeds. When she'd finished one tangerine, she'd wrap up
                    all the seeds in the peel and deposit it in the bowl to her
                    right. She repeated these movements over and over again.
                    When you try to put it in words it doesn't sound like
                    anything special. But if you see it with your own eyes for
                    ten or twenty minutes (almost without thinking, she kept on
                    performing it) gradually the sense of reality is sucked
                    right out of everything around you. It's a very strange
                    feeling.
                </p>
                <p>“You're pretty talented," I told her.</p>
                <p>
                    "This? It's easy. It has nothing to do with talent. What you
                    do isn't make yourself believe that there are tangerines
                    there. You forget that the tangerines are not there. That's
                    all."
                </p>
                <p>I could see we were going to get along.</p>
                <p>
                    We didn't go out all that often. About once a month, twice
                    at most. I'd call her up and ask her where she'd like to go.
                    We'd have something to eat, have a few drinks in a bar, and
                    talk up a storm. I'd listen to her talk, she'd listen to me.
                    We had hardly anything in common to talk about, but that
                    didn't matter. I guess you'd say we were friends. Naturally,
                    I paid for everything, all the food and drink. A few times
                    she called me up, usually when she'd run out of money and
                    was hungry. On those occasions she ate like you wouldn't
                    believe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was completely relaxed when I was with her. I could erase
                    everything from my mind all the work I didn't want to do,
                    the jumble of senseless ideas people carry around in their
                    heads. She had that effect on me. She didn't talk about
                    anything in particular. Often I would just keep nodding my
                    head, not really picking up the gist of her words. But
                    listening to her made me feel relaxed, as if I were gazing
                    at drifting clouds far off in the distance.
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <p>
                    <inline class="padded-dropcap">I</inline>n the spring of the
                    year after we met, her father died, and she inherited a
                    little money from him. At least that's what she told me. She
                    said she wanted to use the money to go to North Africa. I
                    don't know why she picked North Africa, but I went ahead and
                    introduced her to a woman I knew who worked at the Algerian
                    Embassy in Tokyo. So off she went to Algeria. As things
                    turned out, I went to see her off at the airport. She
                    carried just one beat up old bag with a few changes of
                    clothes stuffed inside. Going through the luggage check, she
                    looked more like she was going home to North Africa than
                    taking a trip there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Are you going to come back to Japan?" I asked her,
                    jokingly.
                </p>
                <p>"Of course I am," she replied.</p>
                <p>
                    Three months later she was back, seven pounds lighter and
                    tanned a deep brown and with a new boyfriend. It seemed the
                    two of them met at a restaurant in Algiers. Since there
                    weren't many Japanese there, they grew close. As far as I
                    knew, he was the first steady boyfriend she'd ever had.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was in his late twenties, tall, impeccably dressed, and
                    well spoken. His face was somewhat expressionless, but he
                    was handsome enough, and came across as a pleasant sort of
                    guy. His hands were large, with long fingers. I knew that
                    much about him because I went to pick her up at the airport.
                    A telegram had come all of a sudden from Beirut with just
                    the date and flight number. When the plane arrived (four
                    hours late, because of bad weather) the two of them appeared
                    at the gate arm in arm, looking like some nice young married
                    couple. She introduced me to him, and we shook hands. He had
                    the firm handshake of a person who'd lived abroad a long
                    time. She said she was dying for a bowl of tempura and rice,
                    so we went to a restaurant, and she had some while he and I
                    had a couple of draught beers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I'm in the import export business," he told me. But he
                    didn't say anything more about it. Maybe he didn't want to
                    talk about his job, or maybe he thought I'd find it boring.
                    I didn't ask any questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When she'd finished her tempura, she gave a deep yawn and
                    said she was sleepy. She looked like she was going to fall
                    asleep right on the spot; she had the habit of nodding off
                    at the most unexpected times. He said he'd take her home by
                    cab. I told them the train would be fluster for me. I had no
                    idea why I'd gone to all the trouble of coming out to the
                    airport.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm glad I could get to know you," he said, somewhat
                    apologetically.
                </p>
                <p>"Same here," I replied.</p>

                    <inline class="padded-dropcap">I</inline> saw him again
                    several times after that. Whenever I ran into her, there
                    he'd be, right beside her. And if I had a date with her he'd
                    drive her to wherever we were supposed to meet. He drove a
                    silver sports car, German. I know next to nothing about
                    cars, so I can't really describe it well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "He must be pretty well off, don't you think?" I asked her
                    once.
                </p>
                <p>"Yeah,"she answered without much interest. "Guess so."</p>
                <p>"I wonder if you can make that much in foreign trade."</p>
                <p>"Foreign trade?"</p>
                <p>
                    'That's what he told me. He said he was in foreign trade."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Well, I guess he must be. But I don't know. He doesn't seem
                    to be working anywhere. He meets a lot of people and makes a
                    lot of phone calls, but he doesn't seem to be too wrapped up
                    in it."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just like Gatsby, I thought. A young man who's a riddle. I
                    thought, you have no idea what he does, really, but he never
                    seems to be hurting for money.

                    <inline class="padded-dropcap">S</inline>he called me one
                    Sunday afternoon in October. My wife was out of town
                    visiting some relatives, so I was home all alone. It was a
                    beautiful, clear Sunday, and I was gazing at the trees in
                    the garden, eating an apple. I must have eaten seven apples
                    that day. This happens from time to time—I get a
                    pathological craving for apples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "We were just in the neighborhood and wondered if we could
                    drop by," she said.
                </p>
                <p>"We?" I asked.</p>
                <p>"Him and me," she said.</p>
                <p>"Sure, come on," I said.</p>
                <p>"O.K—we'll be over in half an hour," she said.</p>
                <p>
                    I lay vacantly on the couch for a while, then got up and
                    showered and shaved. I couldn't decide whether I should
                    straighten up the house, and in the end decided not to.
                    There wasn't enough time to do a thorough job of it, and if
                    it can't be done right, I thought, better not bother with it
                    at all. The room was littered with books, magazines,
                    letters, records, pencils, and sweaters, but it didn't look
                    that messy.
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <p>
                    <inline class="padded-dropcap">A</inline>
                    little after two, I heard a car pull up to the house. When I
                    opened the door, I saw the silver sports car at the curb.
                    She stuck her face out the window and waved. I showed them
                    where to park, behind the house.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Well, here we are!" she said with a smile. She wore a light
                    shirt that showed the outline of her figure through it, and
                    an olive green miniskirt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He had on a navy blue blazer. Somehow he seemed different,
                    probably because of his two day growth of beard. Getting out
                    of the car, he took off his sunglasses and stuck them in his
                    pocket.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I'm really sorry to drop in like this all of a sudden on
                    your day off," he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "No problem," I said. "Today is a day off for me. And I was
                    just ready for some company."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "We brought a meal," she said, and she hauled a large white
                    paper sack from the rear seat of the car.
                </p>
                <p>"A meal?"</p>
                <p>
                    "Nothing special. We just thought that since we dropped in
                    on you on a Sunday we'd better bring something to eat," he
                    said.
                </p>
                <p>"Great. All I've had today is apples."</p>
                <p>
                    We went inside and laid the food out on the table. Quite a
                    spread: roast beef sandwiches, salad, smoked salmon, and
                    blueberry ice cream—and plenty of everything. While she
                    arranged it all on plates, I got some white wine out of the
                    refrigerator and uncorked it. It looked like we were having
                    ourselves a little party.
                </p>
                <p>"Let's eat. I'm starved," she said, famished as usual.</p>
                <p>
                    We munched our sandwiches, ate our salad, and helped
                    ourselves to the smoked salmon. When we'd polished off the
                    wine, we drank some canned beer from the fridge. One thing
                    you can always count on at my place, is a fridge full of
                    beer. His color didn't change at all, no matter how much he
                    drank. I’m a pretty good beer drinker myself. She had a
                    couple of cans with us, and in less than an hour the table
                    was lined with empties. She selected a couple of records
                    from the shelf and set them on the player. The first album
                    was Miles Davis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We talked about audio equipment for a while, and he fell
                    quiet. Then he said, "I've got some grass, if you'd care for
                    a smoke."
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wasn't sure how to react. I'd just given up smoking
                    cigarettes a month before; it was touch and go whether I
                    could shake the habit for good, and I had no idea what
                    effect smoking marijuana would have on me. But I decided to
                    give it a try. He took out the dark colored leaves in a foil
                    wrapper from the bottom of the paper sack, rolled the grass
                    into a sheet of cigarette paper, and licked the glued edge.
                    He lit up with his lighter and took a few drags to make sure
                    the joint was going before passing it over to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We sat there silently for a while, smoking without speaking.
                    Miles Davis was over, and a collection of Strauss waltzes
                    began to play. Not your usual programming, I thought. But
                    not bad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After we finished the first joint, she said she was sleepy.
                    She hadn't gotten enough rest the night before, apparently,
                    and the three beers and the grass knocked her out. I showed
                    her upstairs and put her to bed. She asked to borrow a T
                    shirt. I gave her one. She stripped down to her underwear,
                    pulled on the shirt; and lay down on the bed. "Are you
                    cold?" I asked, but she was already snoring away. Shaking my
                    head, I went back downstairs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the living room her boyfriend was rolling a second joint.
                    He was something. Given a choice, I'd rather have snuggled
                    up next to her in bed and taken a good nap, but that was
                    out. I smoked the second joint with him, the Strauss waltzes
                    still going. For some reason I remembered a play we'd done
                    back in grade school. I was the owner of a glove shop. A
                    baby fox comes in looking for gloves, but he doesn't have
                    enough money to buy them.
                </p>
                <p>"You can't buy gloves with that," I say. The villain.</p>
                <p>
                    "But Mama is so cold. Her paws are all chapped. Please!" the
                    baby fox begs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Sorry, but it's not enough. Save up your money and come
                    back later. If you do—"
                </p>
                <p>"—sometimes I burn down barns," he said.</p>
                <p>
                    "Excuse me?" I said. I was drifting off, and I must have
                    heard him wrong.
                </p>
                <p>"Sometimes I burn down barns," he said again.</p>
                <p>
                    I looked at him. He was tracing the design on his lighter
                    with the tip of his fingernail. He sucked the marijuana
                    smoke deep into his lungs, held it there for ten seconds,
                    then slowly let it out. The smoke swirled up like ectoplasm
                    from his mouth. "I brought this stuff back from India,” he
                    said, “The best they had. You smoke this and all kinds of
                    memories rush out at you. Light, smells, things like that.
                    The quality of your memory" he paused in a leisurely way,
                    and, as if searching for the right words, lightly snapped
                    his fingers a couple of times "is like something you've
                    never experienced before. Don't you think so?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do, I told him. I was lost in memories of the commotion on
                    the grade school stage, of the smell of paint on the
                    cardboard scenery.
                </p>
                <p>"I'd like to hear about the barns," I said.</p>
                <p>He gazed at me. His face, as usual, was expressionless.</p>
                <p>"You don't mind me telling you about it?" he asked.</p>
                <p>"Go right ahead," I replied.</p>
                <p>
                    "It's very simple, really. You pour gasoline around, throw
                    on a lighted match and whoosh! It's all over. Takes less
                    than fifteen minutes to burn to the ground. Of course, I'm
                    not talking about large barns. More like sheds, really."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "So..." I said, and I stopped. I couldn't figure out how to
                    go on. "So why do you burn down barns?"
                </p>
                <p>"Is it strange?"</p>
                <p>
                    "I'm not sure. You burn barns, and I don't. Obviously
                    there's a difference between the two.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    He sat there blankly for a time. His mind seemed all twisted
                    around, like putty. Or maybe it was my mind that was all
                    twisted around.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I burn roughly one barn every two months," he said. And
                    snapped his fingers again. “That seems about the right pace.
                    For me, that is."
                </p>
                <p>I nodded vaguely. The right pace?</p>
                <p>"So, are these your own barns you burn?' I asked.</p>
                <p>
                    He looked at me as if he had no idea what I was talking
                    about. "Why would I burn down my own barns? What makes you
                    think I own so many barns?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "So, what you're telling me," I said," is you burn other
                    people's barns, correct?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "That's right," he said. "Of course that's right. Other
                    people's barns. So it's illegal. Just like you and me
                    sitting here smoking grass definitely against the law.”
                </p>
                <p>I was silent, resting my elbows on the arms of the chair.</p>
                <p>
                    "I burn other people's barns without their permission. Of
                    course, I always choose one that won't turn into a four
                    alarm blaze. I don't want to start a fire—just burn down
                    barns."
                </p>
                <p>
                    I nodded, and snuffed out the stub of the joint. "But if
                    you're caught you'll be in trouble. It's arson, after all.
                    You blow it and you could wind up in jail."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I won't get caught," he said casually. "I pour on the
                    gasoline, strike a match, and take off. Then I have a good
                    time watching it all from a distance with binoculars. I
                    won't get caught. The police aren't going to comb the
                    streets over a lousy little barn burning down."
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was probably right, I thought. And no one would ever
                    think that a well dressed young man driving an expensive
                    foreign car would be running around torching barns.
                </p>
                <p>"Does she know about it?" I asked, pointing upstairs.</p>
                <p>
                    "She doesn't know a thing. Actually, I've never told another
                    soul. It's not the kind of topic you can bring up with just
                    anybody."
                </p>
                <p>"Then why me?"</p>
                <p>
                    He spread the fingers of his left hand straight out and
                    rubbed his cheek. The whiskers made a scratchy, dry sound,
                    like a bug crawling over a taut sheet of paper. "You're a
                    writer, so I thought you must be interested in patterns of
                    human behavior. Writers are supposed to appreciate something
                    for what it is, before they hand down a judgment. Besides, I
                    wanted to talk about it with someone. The way I'm explaining
                    it might be a little weird, I guess. The world's full of
                    barns, that are, almost waiting for me to burn them down. A
                    barn all by itself beside the ocean, a barn in the middle of
                    a rice paddy . . . Anyhow, all kinds of barns. Give me
                    fifteen minutes, and I'll burn them to the ground, so it
                    looks like there was never any barn there to begin with. No
                    one gets choked up over it. It just . . . disappears.
                    Whoosh!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "But you're the one who judges that they're expendable,
                    right?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I don't judge anything. The barns are waiting to be burned.
                    I just accept that. I merely accept what's there. It's like
                    the rain. The rain falls. The river swells up. Something
                    gets carried away in the flow. Is the rain making a
                    judgment? It's not like I'm out to commit an immoral act. I
                    have my own code of morality.”

                <p>
                    <inline class="padded-dropcap">W</inline>e sat there, silent
                    and still for a while, waiting, it seemed, for the glow to
                    wear off. I had no clue what I should say next. I felt as if
                    I were looking through a train window watching a weird
                    landscape flash in and out of view.
                </p>
                <p>"Care for another beer?" I asked after a while.</p>
                <p>“Thanks. Don't mind if I do."</p>
                <p>
                    I brought out four cans from the kitchen, along with some
                    Camembert cheese. We had two beers each and ate the cheese.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "When was the last time you burned down a barn?" I asked
                    him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Let me see." He thought for a while. "This summer, the end
                    of August."
                </p>
                <p>"And when are you going to burn down your next one?"</p>
                <p>
                    "I don't know. I'm not going by some schedule, circling
                    dates on the calendar. I burn a barn when I get the urge
                    to."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "But when you want to burn one, there isn't always the kind
                    you're looking for just waiting for you, is there?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Of course not," he said quietly. "So I make sure I've got a
                    good one picked out in advance."
                </p>
                <p>"Have you, already decided on your next barn?"</p>
                <p>
                    Frown lines formed between his eyes. And he breathed in a
                    rush of air through his nose. "Yes. I've already found it."
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn't say anything, just sipped at what was left of my
                    beer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It's a wonderful barn. It's a long time since I've seen one
                    so well worth burning. Actually, I came over here today to
                    check it out."
                </p>
                <p>"You mean it's around here?"</p>
                <p>"Very close by," he said.</p>
                <p>So ended our discussion of barns.</p>
                <br /><br />
                <p>
                    <inline class="padded-dropcap">H</inline>e woke up his
                    girlfriend at five, and apologized again for having dropped

                <p>the house. It had one small nick, near the headlight.</p>
                <p>
                    "I"ll keep an eye out for those barns," I said in farewell.
                </p>
                <p>"Right," he said. "Anyhow, remember it's right nearby?'</p>
                <p>"What do you mean, 'barns'?" she asked.</p>
                <p>"Just something between us men," he replied.</p>
                <p>"I see," she said.</p>
                <p>And they disappeared.</p>
                <br /><br />
                <p>
                    <inline class="padded-dropcap">T</inline>he next day, I went
                    to the bookstore and bought a map of the part of town where
                    I live. Map in hand, I walked the neighborhood, marking with
                    a pencil the location of every barn. Over three days, I
                    explored an area two and a half miles in each direction. My
                    home was on the outskirts of town, with quite a few farms
                    still around, so there were lots of barns. I counted
                    sixteen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The barn he planned to burn must be one of those. The way
                    he'd said that it was right nearby made me sure it wasn't
                    beyond the area I'd covered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, I made a careful check of each of the sixteen barns.
                    First, I eliminated the ones too close to other people's
                    houses. Next, I crossed off the ones that had farm tools and
                    pesticides inside that is, ones that looked as though
                    someone was using them every day. I was sure he wouldn't
                    want to burn one of those.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That left five barns. Five barns that could be burned. The
                    kind that could burn down in fifteen minutes, and would burn
                    clear to the ground—and wouldn't be any loss. But I couldn't
                    decide which of the five he'd pick. It was a question of
                    personal preference. I was dying to find out which one it
                    would be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I spread out the map and erased all but five of the "X"s I'd
                    made. Then I got out my T square, French curve, and divider,
                    and I mapped out the shortest route that would pass all five
                    barns and take me back home. The route curved along the
                    river and over some hills, and ended up being four and one
                    third miles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At six the next morning I put on my jogging outfit and
                    running shoes and ran the length of the course I'd mapped
                    out. Since I usually do three and a half miles every
                    morning, adding an extra mile didn't bother me too much. The
                    scenery wasn't bad, and though there were two railroad
                    crossings along the way, they didn't really slow me down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The course circled the athletic grounds of the college near
                    my house, then ran along the river and nearly two miles up a
                    deserted dirt road. The first barn was halfway up the road.
                    Then the course cut through a wood and up a slight slope.
                    Another barn. A little way off, there was a stable for a
                    racetrack The horses might kick up a little ruckus if they
                    saw a fire, but that's all; they wouldn't get hurt or
                    anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third and fourth barns looked alike, like two ugly old
                    twins. They were only two hundred or so yards apart. Both of
                    them were dilapidated and filthy. If you were going to burn
                    down one of them, you might as well burn the pair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last barn stood beside a railroad crossing, at about the
                    three and a half mile mark. It was clearly abandoned. It
                    faced the road and had a tin Pepsi Cola sign nailed to it.
                    The building itself &mdash; I'm not sure you could even call
                    it a building anymore had mostly collapsed. It fit his
                    description &mdash; a building just waiting for someone to
                    commit it to the flames.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I stopped in front of the last barn, took a few deep
                    breaths, then crossed the railroad tracks and headed home.
                    The run took thirty one minutes and thirty seconds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I ran the same course every morning for a month. But none of
                    the barns burned down. Sometimes the thought hit me that
                    maybe he was trying to get me to burn down a barn. As if
                    he'd filled my head with the image of a barn burning and
                    were steadily inflating it more and more, like putting air
                    in a bicycle tire. There were even times when I thought
                    that, as long as I was waiting for him to do it, I might as
                    well go ahead and strike a match and burn one down. It's
                    just a beat up old barn, right?
                </p>
                <p>
                    But that's going too far. After all, it's not me who burns
                    barns, it's him. No matter how much the image of burning
                    barns might swell up in my head, I'm just not the barn
                    burning type. Maybe he decided on some other barn somewhere.
                    Or was too busy to find the time to burn one.
                </p>
                <br /><br />

                <p>
                    <inline class="padded-dropcap">I</inline> didn't hear from
                    her at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    December came, and with it the end of fall, and the morning
                    air turned cold. No change in the barns, just white frost
                    covering their roofs. The world moved on as always.
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <p>
                    <inline class="padded-dropcap">T</inline>he next time I saw
                    him was that December, a few days before Christmas. Wherever
                    you went, Christmas carols were playing. I was busy walking
                    around town buying presents for all sorts of people. Over
                    near Nogizaki, I spotted his car in the parking lot of a
                    coffee shop. There was no mistaking that silver sports car,
                    with the small scratch next to the left headlight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Without thinking, I went inside. The interior of the shop
                    was dark, with a strong aroma of coffee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People's voices were muted, and baroque music played softly
                    in the background. I spotted him right away. Seated by the
                    window, he was drinking cafe au lait.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just said hello. I didn't tell him I'd seen his car parked
                    out front; I happened to come into the shop and happened to
                    run into him.
                </p>
                <p>"Mind if I sit down?" I asked.</p>
                <p>"Not at all," he said.</p>
                <p>
                    We chatted for a while. But our conversation went nowhere.
                    We didn't have much to say to each other, and his thoughts
                    seemed to be elsewhere. Even so, he didn't appear to mind my
                    sharing his table. He told me about the harbor in Tunisia.
                    And about the shrimp they catch there. It wasn't that he
                    felt obliged to talk; he just wanted to tell me about the
                    shrimp. But the story ran out halfway through, like a
                    trickle of water being sucked up by sand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He raised his hand, called a waiter over, and ordered a
                    second cup of cafe au lait.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "By the way, whatever happened to that barn?" I ventured to
                    ask him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A trace of a smile played at the corners of his mouth. "Ah
                    you still remember, I see," he said. He took his
                    handkerchief out of his pocket, wiped his mouth, and put the
                    handkerchief back in his pocket. "I burned it, of course.
                    Burned it right down. Just like I said I would."
                </p>
                <p>"Near my house?"</p>
                <p>"Yes. Right nearby."</p>
                <p>"When?"</p>
                <p>"A while back, ten days after we dropped by your house."</p>
                <p>
                    Then I told him how I marked the locations of the barns on a
                    map how I ran past them once a day. "So I couldn't have
                    missed it," I said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You're quite meticulous, aren't you?" he said brightly.
                    "Meticulous and logical. But you must have overlooked it.
                    That happens sometimes. A thing's too close, and you miss
                    it."
                </p>
                <p>"Well, I don't get it."</p>
                <p>
                    He straightened his tie and glanced at his watch. “It's too
                    close," he said. "But I have to be going. Why don't we have
                    a nice long talk about it next time? You'll have to excuse
                    me, but someone's waiting for me."
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was no reason to keep him any longer. He stood up and
                    put his cigarettes and lighter in his
                </p>
                <p>pocket.</p>
                <p>
                    "Oh, by the way, have you seen her since that day?" he
                    asked.
                </p>
                <p>"No, I haven't. Have you?"</p>
                <p>
                    "No. I can't get hold of her. She isn't in her apartment, I
                    can't get through by phone, and she hasn't been going to her
                    mime class for a long time."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I imagine she just took off for somewhere. She's done that
                    a number of times."
                </p>
                <p>
                    He stood there, hands stuck in his pockets, and stared at
                    the tabletop. "With no money, for a month and a half. She's
                    not the kind who can make it on her own, you know." He
                    snapped his fingers inside his pocket a couple of times.
                    “She doesn't have a cent," he continued. "Or any real
                    friends, either. Her address book is crammed, but those are
                    just names. There's not a single person she can depend on.
                    You're the only one she trusted. I'm not saying that to be
                    polite. You were someone special to her. Even made me a bit
                    jealous. And I'm not the kind of person who's ever jealous.”
                    He gave a slight sigh and looked at his watch again. "I've
                    really got to be going. Let's get together again sometime."
                </p>
                <p>
                    I nodded. But the right words wouldn't come out. It was
                    always that way. Whenever I was with him the words just
                    wouldn't flow.
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <p>
                    <inline class="padded-dropcap">I</inline> tried calling her
                    a couple of times after that; until the phone company shut
                    off her phone. I was a little worried, so I went to her
                    apartment. Her door was locked. A sheaf of junk mail was
                    stuffed in her mailbox. I couldn't locate the building
                    supervisor, so I couldn't even find out if she still lived
                    there. I tore a page from my appointment book, wrote a note
                    saying, "Get in touch with me,” wrote my name, and dropped
                    it in her mailbox.
                </p>
                <p>Not a word.</p>
                <p>
                    The next time I visited her apartment, there was someone
                    else's nameplate on the door. I knocked, but no one
                    answered. Just like the last time, the building supervisor
                    was nowhere to be found.
                </p>
                <p>So I gave up.</p>
                <p>That was almost a year ago. She just disappeared.</p>
                <br /><br />
                <p>
                    <inline class="padded-dropcap">I</inline> still run past the
                    five barns every morning. No barn in my neighborhood has
                    burned down. And I haven't heard about any barn burning.
                    December's come again, and the winter birds fly overhead.
                    And I keep on getting older.
