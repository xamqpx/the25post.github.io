                    <inline class="padded-dropcap">A</inline>mitai Segev definitely has a thing for maids. The Polaroid on the back of his iPhone, where he&rsquo;s posing with a server at the Asayoru Maid Café in Los Angeles, along with a few friends, is a glaring indication of the fact. When pressed, he will most likely deny it. He will tell you, however, and with great pride, that he is somewhat of an urban legend at Asayoru. They know him by name; he&rsquo;s been there for his twenty-first birthday (which is when the Polaroid was taken), he's gone with friends at least a dozen times, and more recently he volunteered &mdash; probably boozed out of his mind on less than half a pint &mdash; to dance in front of the whole restaurant for one of their performances. By some miracle, it went well. <q>They still talk about you at the cafe sometimes,</q> his friend, Kyle Voong, told him over text in November. <q>You&rsquo;re an icon.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    He says he&rsquo;s an extrovert, but I&rsquo;ve always seen him as otherwise. He is certainly loud at times, and he seems to feed off the energies of other people; but the silences in between tend to be louder, and he seems to treat them as sacred. I remember the one thing that consistently turned him off, as he told me back when he had the time and energy to date women, was when they had far too much energy. In some ways I found it cathartic, to see someone who used to drain all of my energy to finally feel what it was like to be drained.

                <p>
                    The details of how I first met Amitai are hazy. It was August of last year; I had just moved in to start my freshman year at <small>U.S.C.</small>, despite classes being mostly remote (in-person instruction wouldn&rsquo;t start until the next term), and the only people I at least sort of knew were my roommates, a few people I&rsquo;d met at orientation, and a rowdy bunch of upperclassmen I&rsquo;d met by chance on a Discord server. (Amitai was one of those upperclassmen.)
                </p>
                <p style="margin: 0;">
                    Two nights before the first day of classes, the university hosted a huge party spanning the two lawns at the <small>U.S.C.</small> Village, the rest of it jam-packed with hundreds of people in hours-long lines and even more freshmen wandering around confused. Some of us on the Discord server had arranged to meet amidst the chaos. I had no idea what anyone looked like, but somehow I made my way to the spot and Amitai noticed me immediately. The only thing I remember from that night, regrettably, is him shouting, <q><small>JON TWENTY-FIVE FROM USCORD???</small></q> at the top of his lungs. In that instant I considered turning back and running away; but I&rsquo;m glad I stayed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It&rsquo;s become a bit of a running joke that we&rsquo;ve run out of things to say, since we hang out so often, and neither of us really feel like starting the conversation; we&rsquo;ll break the silence scrolling through TikToks with the most insufferable icebreaker questions like, <q>What&rsquo;s your major?</q>  or <q>So you come here often?,</q>  punctuated with his signature hearty laugh. (Nowadays, it&rsquo;s evolved into a shorthand of just saying &ldquo;So, uh...&rdquo; and letting the silence do the rest of the work.) There was never a man alive on this earth for whom the word <q>guffaw</q> could not be more appropriate; and it has a certain rasp to it that makes it all the more contagious. 
                </p>
                
                <p>The very nature of our relationship dictates that I do nothing short of chew the motherfucker out for the sake of this article; so it seems appropriate to say now, loud and clear, that Amitai is possibly the best friend that I have ever had &mdash; or could ever have. I am endlessly grateful for his company, his advice, his Dadaist standup routines, our circular conversations, and the memories he has chosen to share, with me, and with the rest of the world.</p>

                <p><span class="padded-dropcap">T</span>here&rsquo;s much to learn about a Gen Z&rsquo;s personality from their Spotify, and Amitai is no different. Besides the Discord ordeal, the 157-song collaborative playlist we&rsquo;d started in September of 2021 was how we first got to really know each other. We called it <q>demon time,</q> and it was a Frankenstein of a playlist; we shoved in everything from The Strokes to Vierre Cloud to Bryson Tiller to <small>IU</small> to Hayley Heynderickx to King Krule &mdash; anything that we liked, or that we thought the other would like. The music in that playlist defined our friendship at several points: There are at least a few videos out there of us and the others in our friend group screaming <q>The Adults are Talking</q> by The Strokes; we bonded over Ella Fitzgerald and Ellis Larkins&rsquo; rendition of <q>I&rsquo;m Glad There Is You</q>; and more recently, he&rsquo;s taken to making <q>Ditto</q> by NewJeans his entire personality, and he&rsquo;s been trying to drag everyone else down with him. I guess we agree to disagree on that.</p>

                <p>I was pleasantly surprised to find common ground with Amitai on classical music. He, having played the violin (and dabbled in the saxophone, which, I suppose, he doesn&rsquo;t really talk about) when he was younger, grew to love an ever-expanding violin repertoire. I, similarly, came to enjoy works for the piano.</p>

                <p><span class="padded-dropcap">O</span>n 14 January, we went to <small>U.C.L.A.</small>, to see a friend. The rain was a brutal downpour, flooding other parts of California and even threatening to sink the streets downtown underwater. Umbrellas were of little use. Nothing was of any use, really. Our feet were drenched and our feet even more so. But still, we walked this way and that, making the most we could out of the trip. &ldquo;We might as well,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                <p>He drove us to Sawtelle afterwards, not five minutes away from the <small>U.C.L.A.</small> campus, to get dinner. It was curry. It&rsquo;s always curry; he can&rsquo;t get enough of it. Every time we go to a curry house, without fail, he insists on saying at least twice that &ldquo;the food is so good.&rdquo; If he&rsquo;s feeling particularly satisfied, he might even repeat it a third time.</p>

                <p>Between scoops, Kevin (the <small>U.C.L.A.</small> friend) had asked us whether we thought we more closely resembled our mothers or our fathers. Amitai thought for a while, then said, &ldquo;You know what, it&rsquo;s a healthy mix of both.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>&ldquo;Not healthy,&rdquo; I interjected, knowing how he is. He continued.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;My mom is very loud, and she just &hellip; says things,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My dad just has a dry sense of humor</p>
