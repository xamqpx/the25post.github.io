                    <inline class="padded-dropcap">A</inline>mitai Segev definitely has a thing for maids. He won&rsquo;t ever admit it; but the Polaroid on the back of his iPhone says otherwise, where he&rsquo;s posing cutely with servers at the Asayoru Maid Caf√© in Los Angeles. He will tell you, however, and with great pride, that he is somewhat of an urban legend at Asayoru. They know him by name; he&rsquo;s been there for his birthday, he's gone with friends at least a dozen times, and more recently he volunteered &mdash; probably boozed out of his mind on less than half a pint &mdash; to dance in front of the whole restaurant for one of their performances. By some miracle, it went well. &ldquo;They still talk about you at the cafe sometimes,&rdquo; his friend, Kyle Voong, told him over text in November. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an icon.&rdquo;
                </p>

                    He says he&rsquo;s an extrovert, but I&rsquo;ve always seen him as otherwise. He is loud at times, and he seems to feed off the energies of other people; but the silences in between tend to be louder, and he seems to treat them as sacred. I remember the one thing that consistently turned him off, as he told me back when he had the time and energy to date women, was when they had far too much energy. In some ways I found it cathartic, to see someone who used to drain all of my energy to finally feel what it was like to be drained.

                    The details of how I first met Amitai are hazy. It was August of last year; I had just moved in to start my freshman year at U.S.C., despite classes being mostly remote (in-person instruction wouldn&rsquo;t start until the next term), and the only people I at least sort of knew were my roommates, a few people I&rsquo;d met at orientation, and a rowdy bunch of upperclassmen I&rsquo;d met by chance on a Discord server. (Amitai was one of those upperclassmen.) Two nights before the first day of classes, the university hosted a huge party spanning the two lawns at the U.S.C. Village, the rest of it jam-packed with hundreds of people in hours-long lines and even more freshmen wandering around confused.
                </p>
                <p style="margin: 0;">
                    Some of us on the Discord server had arranged to meet amidst the chaos. I had no idea what anyone looked like, but somehow I made my way to the spot and Amitai noticed me immediately. The only thing I remember from that night, regrettably, is him shouting, &ldquo;JON TWENTY-FIVE FROM USCORD???&rdquo; at the top of his lungs. In that instant I considered turning back and running away; but I&rsquo;m glad I stayed.
                </p>

                    It&rsquo;s become a bit of a running joke that we&rsquo;ve run out of things to say, since we hang out so often; we&rsquo;ll break the silence scrolling through TikToks with the most insufferable icebreaker questions like, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your major?&rdquo; or &ldquo;So you come here often?&rdquo;,  punctuated with his signature hearty laugh. There was never a man alive on this earth for whom the word &ldquo;guffaw&rdquo; could not be more appropriate; and it has a certain rasp to it that makes it all the more contagious.
