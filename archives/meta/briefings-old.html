        <p><b>A preliminary ruling</b> from a federal judge suspended the Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s approval of mifepistrone, a prescription medication commonly used for abortions.</p>
        <p>If enacted, the suspension could threaten abortion access regardless of state &mdash; even in states like California with otherwise robust protections for reproductive rights.</p>
        <p>The ruling, by U.S. District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryck,is the culmination of a high-profile case brought forth by the conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, who invoked 19th century anti-obscenity laws to argue that the FDA had overstepped its authority in approving mifepistrone in 2000. Kacsmaryck has delayed the effect of the decision by one week, allowing the Justice Department to appeal.</p>

        <h2>Yemeni officials in Saudi Arabia to discuss ending civil war</h2>

        <p><b>Yemen government officials</b> were in Saudi Arabia Thursday to discuss a three-year plan to end the brutal and prolonged civil war in the country.</p>
        <p>The proposed plan would take place in three stages, a diplomat said. The first phase would be a <q>six-month truce between warring factions in Yemen,</q> making space for efforts to <q>rebuild trust and lay the groundwork for peace.</q> The second stage would be a dialogue addressing grievances among the factions and reopening closed roads and ports. The third would be an establishment of a new Yemeni government.</p>
        <p>A truce between the Yemeni government and the Houthi, an Islamist anti-imperialist rebel faction, is likely to take place shortly, the diplomat said.</p>
        <p>The civil war, ongoing since 2014, began as a Houthi insurgence against the Sunni government, but soon became what many consider a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.</p>

        <p><b>Classified documents</b> leaked from the Department of Defense this past week reveal the Pentagon&rsquo;s extensive trove of data on its adversaries and allies, including Israel, South Korea, and France.</p>
        <p>Among the documents&rsquo; claims are that senior officials in Mossad, Israel&rsquo;s security agency, <q>advocated for Mossad officials and Israeli citizens to protest the new Israeli government&rsquo;s proposed judicial reforms, including several explicit calls to action that decried the Israeli government, according to signals intelligence.</q> Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied this claim in a statement Sunday.</p>
        <p>The documents also claim the U.S. was covertly gathering signals intelligence &mdash; i.e., spying &mdash; on allies in Seoul, amid ongoing pressures for President Yoon seok-yeol to supply weaponry to Ukraine in violation of national policy. South Korean government officials said they would <q>have necessary consultations with the US side</q> related to the leak.</p>

        <h2>Russia announces espionage charges against Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich</h2>
        <img src="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/08/GettyImages-1249927979-scaled.jpg">
        <p class="photo-credit">Dimitar Dilkoff | AFP | Getty Images</p>
        <p><b>Russian state news outlets</b> reported Friday that Gershkovich was formally charged for espionage &mdash; an allegation he has denied &mdash; indicating the start of a criminal probe by a country whose charges brought against journalists are rarely overturned in court.</p>
        <p>Gershkovich is the first U.S. journalist to be detained on espionage charges by Russia since the Cold War.</p>
        <p>The news comes as a rare bipartisan statement Friday from the United States &mdash; by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell &mdash; demanded Russia release Gershkovich immediately, praising him as a <q>“internationally known and respected independent journalist.</q></p>
        <p>The FSB, Russia&rsquo;s security agency, has claimed Gershkovich <q>was caught red-handed while trying to obtain secret information, using his journalistic status as a cover for illegal actions.</q> </p>

        <p><b>More than 100 documents</b>  containing sensitive information about U.S. national security secrets on Ukraine, the Middle East and China, appeared on social media sites Friday, officials said. This comes just one day after a similar batch of documents pertaining to U.S. and NATO plans for the Russian invasion of Ukraine surfaced on Twitter and Telegram Thursday.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon, having acknowledged the authenticity of the documents, is scrambling to scrub them from the sites &mdash; attempts at which are proving largely unsuccessful. The Justice Department said it is investigating the matter.</p>
        <p>Documents include photographs of charts of anticipated weapons deliveries, troop and battalion strengths, and other plans, the New York Times reported. Some documents, however, appear to have been altered in part, with U.S. estimates of Ukrainian war casualties overstated and estimates of Russian troops kittled understated.</p>
        <p><q>As many of these were pictures of documents, it appears that it was a deliberate leak done by someone that wished to damage the Ukraine, U.S., and NATO efforts,</q> said Mick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official.</p>

        <p><b>The governor's office</b> said Friday that it would continue its business with the pharmacy chain, as legal experts told the Los Angeles Times that the state is bound to do so by federal law.</p>
        <p>Newsom had announced in March that it would halt the renewal of Walgreens&rsquo; contract, taking issue with the chain&rsquo;s decision to not sell mifepristone in states cracking down on abortion. But law pertaining to the Medi-Cal program, through which California pays Walgreens, dictates that eligible patients can pick up their medications at any approved pharmacy.</p>
        <p><q>California has no intention of taking any action that would violate federal Medicaid requirements, or that could undermine access for low-income individuals,</q> a spokesperson for the governor wrote in a statement to the L.A. Times. Another spokesperson said that <q>tweeting is not policy,</q> and that Newsom would not <q>take any action that hurts people who need access to care.</q></p>

        <p><b>Two of three House members</b>, all Democrats, who joined gun control protests in the wake of the Nashville shooting, have been expelled from the legislature. Both members facing expulsion, Reps. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, are Black, while the third member &mdash; Rep. Gloria Johnson, who is white &mdash; narrowly stayed on in a vote almost strictly along party lines. The extraordinary move has some criticizing the Republican supermajority for acting in their political interest, unbeholden to the Democratic opposition and the will of the Tennesseean people.</p>

        <p class="quote">The case of the two Tennessee Democrats involves neither criminal nor immoral conduct nor the mere statement of opinions. It involves conduct &mdash; encouraging demonstrations and bringing a bullhorn and posters to the state House floor &mdash; that violates the rules of the House. Still, the legislature has never imposed before so severe a penalty for rules violations, and over the past few years, a number of legislators have kept their posts even after being charged with serious sexual misconduct.</p>

        <p><b>&ldquo;The extent and frequency</b> of [Harlan] Crow&rsquo;s apparent gifts to Thomas have no known precedent in the modern history of the U.S. Supreme Court,&rdquo; declared a ProPublica investigation, published Thursday.</p>
        <p>Thomas accompanied Crow, a prominent conservative donor and real estate billionaire, on trips to Indonesia, rides on his superyacht and his private jet, Crow's own ranch, and an exclusive all-male retreat in California, according to the report. Crow has insisted that he and his wife <q>have never sought to influence Justice Thomas on any legal or political issue,</q> but he has spent millions of dollars in shaping the judiciary and keeping his firm out of legal trouble, the report alleges.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers have called for stronger and better-enforced ethics standards for Supreme Court justices; but it remains doubtful whether such changes would be implemented, or if Thomas will be held accountable for his failure to disclose.</p>

        <p><b>The Israel Defense Forces</b> struck parts of southern Lebanon and Gaza, with Israeli authorities saying the strikes had targeted key locations for Hamas, the Palestinian militant group. The violence came mere hours after similar airstrikes from Lebanon into Israeli territory, in apparent retaliation for an Israeli police raid earlier this week of the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>The Israeli military, attributing the attacks on its territory to Hamas, targeted 10 sites in Gaza, including production sites, research and development sites, and tunnel infrastructure, Hamas said. The IDF, in turn, said it hit weapons manufacturing sites and <q>terror</q> tunnels.</p>
        <p>U.S. State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters Thursday evening that it <q>strongly</q> condemned Lebanon&rsquo;s attacks against Israel, and that Israel had the <q>legitimate right to defend itself against all forms of aggression.</q></p>

Bobby Portis Jr., Brook Lopez, and Jrue Holiday each stepped in with 27, 26, and 26 points, respectively.</p>

        <p><b>The doomer headlines</b> of the Mavericks having utterly blown their chances will at last be staved off for a little while, with a 123-119 win against the Kings reviving some enthusiasm for the once-upon-a-time playoff-hopefuls.</p> 
        <p>After a dismal first half, as usual &mdash; <q>At one point, [Sacramento] missed 12 of 13 shots. But they found their rhythm, as teams often do against the Mavericks,</q> read a Mavs Moneyball game recap &mdash; Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic seemed to have finally found their own rhythm as well. Irving topped the scoreboard with 31 points, 19 of which were fourth quarter; Doncic followed suit with 29 and 10 rebounds.</p>
        <p>While some are lamenting what appears to be a complete downfall after the Irving trade &mdash; their playoff chances dipped to 6% from 58% since the trade deadline &mdash; others wonder whether there&rsquo;s still a chance to make the play-in. </p>
