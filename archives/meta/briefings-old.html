        <h2>Tennessee's House votes to expel two members for joining gun control protests</h2>

        <p><b>Two of three House members</b>, all Democrats, who joined gun control protests in the wake of the Nashville shooting, have been expelled from the legislature. Both members facing expulsion, Reps. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, are Black, while the third member &mdash; Rep. Gloria Johnson, who is white &mdash; narrowly stayed on in a vote almost strictly along party lines. The extraordinary move has some criticizing the Republican supermajority for acting in their political interest, unbeholden to the Democratic opposition and the will of the Tennesseean people.</p>
        <p>Jeff Greenfield for <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/04/06/tennessee-expulsion-future-democrats-00090911">Politico</a>:</p>
        <p class="quote">The case of the two Tennessee Democrats involves neither criminal nor immoral conduct nor the mere statement of opinions. It involves conduct &mdash; encouraging demonstrations and bringing a bullhorn and posters to the state House floor &mdash; that violates the rules of the House. Still, the legislature has never imposed before so severe a penalty for rules violations, and over the past few years, a number of legislators have kept their posts even after being charged with serious sexual misconduct.</p>

        <h2>ProPublica: Clarence Thomas failed to disclose luxury vacations with conservative donor</h2>

        <p><b>&ldquo;The extent and frequency</b> of [Harlan] Crow&rsquo;s apparent gifts to Thomas have no known precedent in the modern history of the U.S. Supreme Court,&rdquo; declared a ProPublica investigation, published Thursday.</p>
        <p>Thomas accompanied Crow, a prominent conservative donor and real estate billionaire, on trips to Indonesia, rides on his superyacht and his private jet, Crow's own ranch, and an exclusive all-male retreat in California, according to the report. Crow has insisted that he and his wife <q>have never sought to influence Justice Thomas on any legal or political issue,</q> but he has spent millions of dollars in shaping the judiciary and keeping his firm out of legal trouble, the report alleges.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers have called for stronger and better-enforced ethics standards for Supreme Court justices; but it remains doubtful whether such changes would be implemented, or if Thomas will be held accountable for his failure to disclose.</p>

        <h2>Israel launches airstrikes on Lebanon, Gaza</h2>

        <p><b>The Israel Defense Forces</b> struck parts of southern Lebanon and Gaza, with Israeli authorities saying the strikes had targeted key locations for Hamas, the Palestinian militant group. The violence came mere hours after similar airstrikes from Lebanon into Israeli territory, in apparent retaliation for an Israeli police raid earlier this week of the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>The Israeli military, attributing the attacks on its territory to Hamas, targeted 10 sites in Gaza, including production sites, research and development sites, and tunnel infrastructure, Hamas said. The IDF, in turn, said it hit weapons manufacturing sites and <q>terror</q> tunnels.</p>
        <p>U.S. State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters Thursday evening that it <q>strongly</q> condemned Lebanon&rsquo;s attacks against Israel, and that Israel had the <q>legitimate right to defend itself against all forms of aggression.</q></p>

        <p><b>Progressives secured</b> a long-awaited victory as the liberal judge won her election by an astounding 11% margin. Protasiewicz&rsquo;s win comes at a crucial time for reproductive rights; conservative justices up to this point had held a majority in the state supreme court, and upcoming rulings on Wisconsin&rsquo;s abortion law meant the future of abortion access had hinged on this election.</p>
        <p>Protasiewicz previously served at the Milwaukee County Circuit Court, to which she was elected as a judge in 2014 &mdash; and before that, she was a prosecutor in Milwaukee County with a focus on domestic abuse and other violent crimes.</p>

        <p><b>Tsai Ing-wen</b> made a brief visit in Simi Valley, meeting with the U.S. Speaker of the House in what the New York Times reported was <q>a carefully choreographed series of meetings.</q> The move was an apparent attempt to avoid furthering tensions in the Taiwan Strait &mdash; already made sour when Nancy Pelosi, McCarthy&rsquo;s predecessor, ignored threats of retaliation from China to visit the island.</p>
        <p>Though the visit was more tame than the promises of unabashed defiance McCarthy had made during the midterm elections, he told reporters after the meetings that a visit of his own to Taiwan was not off the table.</p>
        <p><q>I am the speaker of the House,</q> he said. <q>There is no place that China&rsquo;s going to tell me where I can go and who I can speak to, whether you be foe or whether you be friend.</q></p>
        <p>Tsai, who will continue a 10-day stint traveling to New York, Guatemala, and Belize, said the meeting would <q>reassure the people of Taiwan that we are not isolated and we are not alone.</q></p>

        <p><b>The Maryland attorney general's office</b> on Wednesday released its report, concluding a lengthy investigation into 80 years of abuse and coverup.</p>
        <p>The nearly 500-page report was the subject of intense legal battles over its release &mdash; until February, when a judge ordered a redacted version of the report be released, writing: <q>[The] only form of justice that may now be available is a public reckoning.</q></p>
        <p>These revelations come as ever frequent reports in recent years have brought systemic abuses in the Catholic Church to light. A 2019 CNN investigative report detailed harrowing accounts of abuse, by <q><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2019/12/us/salesians-of-don-bosco-intl/">pedophile priests</a></q> at a California school. Just across northern California, <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/clergy-abuse-scandal-investigation/3162757/">1,500 lawsuits against the Catholic Church</a> had been filed throughout the state's three-year lookback window, plaintiffs&rsquo; attorneys said.</p>

        <p><b>Milwaukee took home</b> an easy 105-92 victory against Chicago Wednesday night, and with it the best record in the league &mdash; a feat made more impressive by star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo&rsquo;s absence, and Khris Middleton and Grayson Allen also being sidelined due to injuries. Bobby Portis Jr., Brook Lopez, and Jrue Holiday each stepped in with 27, 26, and 26 points, respectively.</p>
        <p>The Bucks&rsquo; 58-22 record began as a 9-0, which eventually faltered in a mid-season slump, bringing them as low as fourth. From January to March, however, a 16-win streak &mdash; tied for third longest in franchise history &mdash; set the stage for complete dominance of the league.</p>

        <p><b>The doomer headlines</b> of the Mavericks having utterly blown their chances will at last be staved off for a little while, with a 123-119 win against the Kings reviving some enthusiasm for the once-upon-a-time playoff-hopefuls.</p> 
        <p>After a dismal first half, as usual &mdash; <q>At one point, [Sacramento] missed 12 of 13 shots. But they found their rhythm, as teams often do against the Mavericks,</q> read a Mavs Moneyball game recap &mdash; Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic seemed to have finally found their own rhythm as well. Irving topped the scoreboard with 31 points, 19 of which were fourth quarter; Doncic followed suit with 29 and 10 rebounds.</p>
        <p>While some are lamenting what appears to be a complete downfall after the Irving trade &mdash; their playoff chances dipped to 6% from 58% since the trade deadline &mdash; others wonder whether there&rsquo;s still a chance to make the play-in. </p>
