        <p>6 July 2022</p>
        <small>PHOTO: NETFLIX</small>
        
    </div>
    <div class="main">
        <p>
          <p><i style="color:grey">This article contains spoilers for the Netflix series &ldquo;Heartstopper&rdquo; and corresponding portions of Alice Oseman&rsquo;s original webcomic.</i></p>

<p><inline class="padded-dropcap">I</inline> am so late to all this. Six years ago, writer Alice Oseman began writing a webcomic about a rugby chav and an openly gay nerd falling in love; by last April, that webcomic turned into a TV series released on Netflix to widespread critical acclaim. I somehow missed the memo.</p>

<p>My TikTok algorithm certainly didn&rsquo;t. I remember around April or May, I wound up on a clip of this series where two boys were flirting in a bedroom. They kissed. The show was called &ldquo;Heartstopper.&rdquo; I forgot about it.</p>

<p>It is now July. Three months after Heartstopper caught the world by storm, so too did it catch me. I&rsquo;ve watched it five times. I&rsquo;ve memorized every line. I&rsquo;ve cried and laughed to every song on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX5KARSfd7WcM?si=48a54ae194944917">mixtape</a>. Anyone who knows me must think I&rsquo;ve gone insane, and I have. This show has enraptured me in a way which I never would have imagined for a TV series and for damn good reason.</p>

<img class="center" src="../HEARTSTOPPER1 25POST.jpg">

<p>The word &ldquo;relatable&rdquo; has been used to describe Oseman&rsquo;s teen drama <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/hearstopper-netflix-fans-scene-relatable-b2064771.html">again</a> and <a href="https://thewesternhemisphere.org/9528/ae/comically-queer-heartstopper-review/">again</a> and <a href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/entertainment/tv/heartstopper-netflix-lgbtq-drama-adaptation-series-first-look/629300">again</a>, but it&rsquo;s really worth saying one more time. Never in my life have I seen a piece of self-advertised queer media so perfectly capture the queer experience. I can say with a great deal of confidence that I&rsquo;ve had every single conversation in real life that Charlie Spring (Joe Locke) has in Heartstopper: the &ldquo;supportive straight friend&rdquo; baiting tactic, the &ldquo;meddling gays&rdquo; groupchat, the flirty dialogue (&ldquo;I thought you liked my arms?&rdquo;) at the bowling alley with Nick Nelson (Kit Connor), the &ldquo;why are we like this?&rdquo;, the &ldquo;you&rsquo;re nothing like him&rdquo; (arguably the show&rsquo;s worst line, however wholesome Charlie&rsquo;s intent), et cetera. For the first time, I feel seen, and I actually like that I feel seen.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m aware there are plenty other queer media that make queer people &ldquo;feel seen,&rdquo; e.g. <i>Call Me By Your Name</i> (2017) or <i>Moonlight</i> (2016) or <i>Love, Simon</i> (2018), but only such that they force us to reckon with the brutal realities and pessimistic outcomes we already face in our own lives regardless. Confronting the unaccepting abusive parents and homophobic bullies and discriminatory governments of the world is a necessary and important task, but one I&rsquo;m not necessarily up for when I boot up Netflix or go to a theater.</p>

<img class="center" src="../HEARTSTOPPER2 25POST.jpg">

<p>There is hardly such a drastic call to action in &ldquo;Heartstopper.&rdquo; All of the parents are supportive, most of the teachers are supportive (those who aren&rsquo;t are only mentioned in passing), the bullies are laughable except when they call Charlie a fag, kids don&rsquo;t out themselves or each other for any reason until they are ready; and for the openly queer characters, their identity is a fact of life the nature of which is hardly discussed. Elle (Yasmin Finney), a transgender girl, is not once explicitly described as transgender; the show only implies as much given she transferred from an all-boys&rsquo; school to an all-girls&rsquo; school and Tao (Will Gao) calls one of her old teachers a transphobe for repeatedly deadnaming her. (I&rsquo;m stealing most of these points from hugojae on YouTube, whose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR1HiSzNhKo">critique of Heartstopper</a> is comprehensive and incredible.)</p>

</center>

<p>I am in no position to state how the transgender community feel about their representation; but to the extent to which it applies to myself, these considerations make &ldquo;Heartstopper&rdquo; beyond refreshing. I would dare call this series the media version of a queer safe space &mdash; where queer love can blossom free of the fundamental threats against life and liberty we still face in our world today, where homophobia needn&rsquo;t be the only source of dramatic tension, where queer love can be realistic and wholesome and not just sex-driven madness, where queer media can exist for queer people and by queer people.</p>

<p>For Kit Connor and Joe Locke, this is their first-ever lead role in a large-scale production &mdash; and already they are the face of a revolution in LGBTQ+ representation. It is incredibly encouraging to see how they&rsquo;ve readily embraced this, throughout their press tours and beyond. Locke, who is openly gay, frequently talks of his experiences during interviews. Connor, amid a flurry of unsolicited speculation on Twitter regarding his and Locke&rsquo;s sexuality (entirely missing a key point of the show), promptly shut it down May 3.</p>
<center>
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">twitter is so funny man. apparently some people on here know my sexuality better than I do…</p>&mdash; Kit Connor (@kit_connor) <a href="https://twitter.com/kit_connor/status/1521245416901296128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 2, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
</center>

<p>&ldquo;It feels strange to make assumptions about someone&rsquo;s sexuality just based on hearing their voice or seeing their appearance,&rdquo; Connor said on the Reign with Josh Smith <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ2FCO8J74s">podcast</a> following the incident. &ldquo;I feel like that&rsquo;s a very interesting, slightly problematic assumption to make.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as to pedestal Connor as some white-knight savior figure, as <a href="https://twitter.com/kit_connor/status/1543251981426360330">some</a> seem to be doing. The openly queer actors deserve the spotlight first and foremost. But he is showing his support whenever he can, most recently at London Pride last weekend, and as with the rest of the cast he is playing out a story that matters to hundreds of thousands of people around the world, to a younger generation growing up needing the same thing we needed.</p>

<p>I think often of the scene in Episode 5 where Nick and Charlie confess their feelings for one another; Nick leans against the claw machine, says, &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d met you when I was younger. &#8230; I wish I knew then what I know now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The line reminds me of the one thing I&rsquo;ve been consistently thinking while watching and re-watching this series: I wish I&rsquo;d had this when I was younger. And in many ways I am jealous of the people who are younger and do have this. I am jealous of the cringe fan edits and the crack YTPs with four hundred views and the boundless energy of those Twitter stans. Perhaps maturing is realizing that being jealous of the younger kids is a good sign, a sign that our future will be bright. And I&rsquo;m not quite too old to be celebrating this moment with them anyhow.<br>
