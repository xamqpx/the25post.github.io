                <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">I</inline>n 1804, a group of former enslaved Black Haitians emerged victorious against French colonists, making history as the first nation in the Americas to abolish slavery. A bitter France and a terrified pre-Civil War United States ensured the victory was short-lived and brutally pyrrhic. France, for one, forced Haiti to pay reparations to their own enslavers lest they be invaded again &mdash; a debt which, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/20/world/americas/haiti-history-colonized-france.html">2022 New York Times investigation</a> found, forever crippled the nation&rsquo;s economy and forced Haitians into menial, little-paid labor for the U.S. and France anyway. The United States refused at first to acknowledge Haiti at all, though the nations did engage in trade until France pressured the U.S. into enacting an embargo. (It was only during the Civil War, when it was of adequate political benefit to acknowledge liberated Black people, that Haiti was at last recognized.) During the Cold War, the U.S., seeing Haiti as a prime target of its next-door neighbor communist Cuba, installed ruthless right-wing dictators who committed unspeakable atrocities in the name of power of profit.</p>

                <p>Some decades, and several more &lsquo;foreign interventions&rsquo; &mdash; read: manufactured crises &mdash; later, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is again calling for deployment of specialized forces in Haiti to take down the ongoing gang violence brutalizing the country. The UN said Tuesday that 187 people have been killed in the past 11 days in gang-related incidents, as political turmoil continues to rock Haiti following the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Mo&iuml;se.</p>

                <p>On Wednesday, I phoned Niels Frenzen, clinical professor of law and director of the Immigration Clinic at the Gould School of Law, to discuss the history of U.S.-Haiti relations and the potential impacts of another foreign intervention should it occur. Frenzen, who has been teaching at USC since 2000, previously served as the supervising attorney at the Haitian Refugee Center, a &ldquo;Haitian refugee-founded and Haitian refugee-run&rdquo; organization based in Miami, as he told me. He also served as the legislative coordinator of the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, and the directing attorney of the Immigrants' Rights Project at Public Counsel here in Los Angeles.</p>

                <p>Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>

                <p><b>Were there any particular cases [working at the HRC], or people that you represented, that come to mind?</b></p>

                <p>There definitely are several. One thing that stands out about Haitians seeking asylum in the United States in the 1980s is the horrific discriminations that they were subjected to by the U.S. government &mdash; that continues to this day, in regard to how Haitians have been treated by the Trump administration, and continue to be treated by the Biden administration.</p>

                <p>In the United States, when you look at how discriminatory our asylum laws are, Haitians have historically [been], and continue to be, treated worse than Central Americans, who are treated by U.S. immigration laws &mdash; even just talking about the asylum context. That&rsquo;s the general recollection: very few Haitians&rsquo; asylum claims were successful. Back in the day &mdash; I can&rsquo;t remember what the approval rate was for Haitian asylum applications, but it was somewhere in the neighborhood of less than 2%. [As of 2021, Haitian migrants still have the <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/haitian-migrants-have-lowest-rate-us-asylum-approvals-since-2018-1632520">lowest asylum approval rate</a>, at just under 5%.]</p>

                <p>The other outstanding aspect of immigration laws is that the modern immigration detention system that we have in the United States today is something that stems from nationality-based detention of Haitians by the Reagan administration, <a href="https://www.oas.org/juridico/english/gavigane.html#:~:text=The%20Reagan%20Administration%20shifted%20US,federal%20prisons%20and%20INS%20centers.">beginning in [1981]</a>.</p>

                <p><b>Haiti was the first country to abolish slavery [in the Americas], and it served as the symbol of the victory of enslaved Black people over their enslavers. There was a particular racism that was targeted to Haiti because of that fact; so I was wondering if you could expand on how racist attitudes toward Haiti informed U.S., and even global, policies regarding the country?</b></p>

                <p>Haiti was not diplomatically recognized by the United States until after the U.S. Civil War. So, if you just think about the United States as a slave country during this time: When a small nation about 700 miles off the Florida coast, has a successful slave rebellion, that, certainly by the U.S. government at the time, is seen as what we would refer to today as a national security risk. So the U.S., in those early days of the Haitian Revolution, sought to quarantine Haiti, to try to interfere with communication and [prevent] what the U.S. government feared would be a sparking of similar rebellions in the United States. So Haiti was already seen as a threat to the United States from day one of Haitian independence.</p>

                <p>One can never overstate the role that race has played, in that [Haiti] is a predominantly Black country, and has suffered because of institutional racism &mdash; [which] is so much a part of the American experience.</p>

                <p><b>To what extent, especially in your experience representing such individuals, does resistance to Haitian refugees and asylum seekers exist today?</b></p>

                <p>Haitians have, at various times, fled to the United States in large numbers, due to political terror and violence, due to climate disaster, and obviously, the massive Port-au-Prince earthquake [in 2010]. And there&rsquo;s always just been this fear &mdash; societal fear, governmental fear &mdash; of hundreds of thousands of Black Haitians coming to the United States in large numbers.</p>

                <p>There was this image in the early days of the Biden administration of the Haitians who were attempting to come into the United States, during the so-called Title 42 COVID shutdown &mdash; instituted by the Trump administration, continued by the Biden administration. COVID was being used as an excuse to prevent people from pursuing asylum in the United States. There were some particularly powerful pictures of Border Patrol agents seeming to whip Haitian men [while] on horseback. Just a very symbolic picture; it&rsquo;s very representative of the discriminatory manner in which Haitians are continuing to be treated.</p>

                <p><b>Moving to the present prospects of foreign intervention: On Tuesday, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called for a deployment of specialized forces in Haiti to take down the gang violence that&rsquo;s ongoing.</b></p>

                <p>The United Nations and the U.S. and Canada, among other countries, have been talking about renewed intervention of some sort in Haiti. And, you know, that has been done. It has been done for over 100 years, on several occasions, and nothing good comes of it. Certainly, I am a believer in humanitarian intervention by force, as a principle. I think there&rsquo;s a basis for it; it&rsquo;s a contested basis, but there&rsquo;s a basis for it in international law. It&rsquo;s just very difficult to do successfully.</p>

                <p><b>There&rsquo;s a sense in which you could argue that the U.S. and France have continued to conduct &lsquo;foreign interventions,&rsquo; even way back in the past, and manufactured the crisis that exists today: installing dictators, making Haiti pay reparations to France after they won the revolution, installing gangs to keep [political leaders] in power, et cetera. So Haitians are obviously wary of foreign intervention, no matter if it&rsquo;s being rebranded as humanitarian aid these days. So I guess the big-picture question is: How do we tow the line between the humanitarian aid that the U.S. and the UN is trying to do now, and basically meddling in Haitian affairs as they did before?</b></p>

                <p>There aren&rsquo;t many good options &mdash; if any good options &mdash; that are on the table. Humanitarian assistance has been deployed in Haiti with devastating effects. Some humanitarian assistance in the form of food aid from the United States has been motivated in part by U.S. decisions that are based upon helping American corporate farmers. If you look at the &ldquo;humanitarian&rdquo; donation of rice to Haiti from the United States, [it] has undermined rice growing by small farmers in Haiti, because they couldn&rsquo;t sell their rice [when American rice was] being sold in markets for prices than what was domestically grown.</p>

                <p>You asked me about some of the cases I remember working on; Back in the 80s in Miami, one of the asylum cases I worked on was an organizer against a U.S. humanitarian program that was designed to eliminate the Haitian pig, because of concerns about swine flu impacting the American commercial pork industry. [The U.S. government was] destroying the Creole pigs and replacing them with Iowa pigs. There were just these bizarre stories about the American pigs that were transplanted to Haiti, who could not survive because of the conditions in Haiti that they were not adapted to.</p>

                <p><b>If there was anything else you wanted to add.</b></p>

                <p>Just on the military intervention point of view: It&rsquo;s just like, What would the United States, or what would an international force, do? Are they going to go in there and kill gang members? Certainly, there are some really bad people who are involved in the gangs. But Haitian political leaders are involved with the gangs. It&rsquo;s not like a situation where we have two armies fighting one another and we&rsquo;re talking about putting peacekeepers between two armies. [There are certainly] territorial areas where gangs are operating, but it&rsquo;s just unclear what a military force would do, other than to go in and kill people.</p>

                <p>Is that the stated objective? to go in eliminating gangs by killing, locking them up? There&rsquo;s just no feasibility of doing something like that, and what would flow from that if it were to happen? It just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense whatsoever.&nbsp;&#9632;</p>
