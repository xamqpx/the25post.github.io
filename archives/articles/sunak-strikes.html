                <p style="color:grey"><i>An edited version of this article originally appeared in the <a href="https://dailytrojan.com/2023/01/10/bursting-your-bubble-sunaks-britain-is-allergic-to-doing-the-right-thing/" style="color:grey">Daily Trojan</a>.</i></p>

                <p><span class="padded-dropcap">I</span>f I weren&rsquo;t writing a column on the very subject, I would say I&rsquo;m at a complete loss for words at the omni-crisis developing in Britain. Nurses, ambulance staff, postal workers, and others have been going on strike for the past God knows how long, with the simplest of demands imaginable: higher pay. During a cost-of-living crisis, no less. 15 December, in particular, saw the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-63946730">largest nursing strike</a> in the history of the National Health Service. Britain is feeling the effects far and wide: with hospitals, especially emergency rooms (A&amp;E, as Brits call it), understaffed, people are finding it <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/81/health-and-social-care-committee/news/172310/persistent-understaffing-of-nhs-a-serious-risk-to-patient-safety-warn-mps/">increasingly difficult</a> to access basic healthcare services, never mind life-saving treatment.</p>

                <p>Yet still, the man at 10 Downing Street, singularly responsible for addressing the situation, has offered nothing in return. Nay, worse: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/05/uk-ministers-announce-anti-strike-legislation">anti-strike legislation</a>.</p>

                <p>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak&rsquo;s genius law, unveiled Thursday and set to be formally introduced in Parliament in a few weeks, will enforce &ldquo;minimum service levels&rdquo; in certain public sectors and allow employers to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/09/uk-pm-sunak-seeks-constructive-talks-with-unions-amid-new-anti-strike-laws.html">sack and sue workers</a> who violate said levels. In short, it&rsquo;s a threat to make fighting for workers&rsquo; rights illegal. &ldquo;I fully believe in the unions&rsquo; role in our society and the freedom for them to strike,&rdquo; Sunak told broadcasters on Friday. &ldquo;I also believe that that should be balanced with the right of ordinary working people to go about their lives free from significant disruption.&rdquo; Faced with enormous backlash, he went on to reassure the nation, quite reassuringly, that the law was &ldquo;<a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/unions-claim-anti-strike-laws-breach-human-rights-rishi-sunak-2069832">entirely reasonable</a>.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s an unspoken principle which states that good people needn&rsquo;t explicitly announce that they are good; I have a feeling the same applies here.</p>

                <p>As we&rsquo;ve come to expect in government, the only appropriate reaction to this legislation has only been coming from one side of the aisle: Keir Starmer, head of the Labour opposition, immediately pledged to <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/sir-keir-starmer-pledges-to-repeal-any-new-anti-strike-laws-in-first-big-speech-of-the-year-as-rail-union-warns-legislation-could-lead-to-longer-strife-12780233">repeal the law</a> were Labour to win the next general election &mdash; which is expected to be as soon as next year. Labour indeed <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/">looks favored to win</a>, which offers only minor relief; the immediate reality is that people will die if workers&rsquo; demands continue to be ignored. If and when they do, their blood will be on Sunak&rsquo;s hands.</p>

                <p>Even worse, he does not care. Sunak <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-64202855">refuses to say</a> whether he uses private healthcare, staunchly defending it as &ldquo;not really relevant&rdquo; and a matter of &ldquo;personal choice.&rdquo; Mindblowingly privileged words coming from a mindblowingly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/28/sunak-is-almost-a-billionaire-with-a-net-worth-double-king-charles.html">privileged person</a>, who can simply afford to bring down public healthcare and blame it on anyone except himself.</p>

                <p>I&rsquo;m particularly concerned with what this means for the rest of us. Here in the U.S., we&rsquo;ve also witnessed strikes in recent months: 48,000 University of California graduate student workers went on a five-week strike starting November, culminating in a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-12-16/after-strike-uc-grad-students-tentative-agreement">pay raise</a> which was, as one student later <a href="https://twitter.com/fox_emilyc/status/1603917731744530432">tweeted</a>, &ldquo;enough to disqualify us for [government] assistance programs and bump us to the next tax bracket, but not enough to cover&rdquo; the heightened living costs that forced them to strike in the first place. In December, President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-signs-bill-block-us-railroad-strike-2022-12-02/">signed legislation</a> forcing railroad unions to accept a contract deal which failed to guarantee paid sick days, all to avoid an economically devastating rail strike.</p>

                <p>With the Sunak catastrophe now added to this growing list of strikes, it&rsquo;s becoming clear that workers&rsquo; rights are at a crossroads. If the Prime Minister&rsquo;s threat against a strike of such high caliber &mdash; with its concentrated media attention, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-16/britain-suffers-most-days-lost-to-strikes-since-thatcher">economic impact</a>, and disruption of daily life &mdash; were to succeed, I worry for smaller unions that could never dream to be as important.</p>

                <p>The pattern is well-established. A business does what it does best &mdash; maximizing profit at the workers&rsquo; expense &mdash; praying the workers won&rsquo;t have the guts to stand up for themselves. The workers do, in fact, have the guts, and stand up for themselves; the business then either rushes them into deals that hardly satisfy their demands, or wait until they exhaust themselves. We&rsquo;ve seen it with the U.C. strikes; we&rsquo;ve seen it with the U.S. rail strikes (although I must credit Biden for breaking this pattern by rushing the deal before strikes even happened); and God forbid we see it again in the U.K. Given the sheer length and persistence of the strikes, and continued <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/support-nurse-strikes-falls-though-still-outweighs-opposition-half-say-pay-rise-theyre-asking-too">majority support</a> from the public, however, there is yet hope.</p>

                <p>For now, Sunak&rsquo;s threat has proved fruitless. Union leaders briefly obliged to the PM&rsquo;s calls for negotiations, at which he then suggested that nurses demonstrate productivity &mdash; i.e., just work harder &mdash; in return for a one-off payment, the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jan/09/strikes-junior-doctors-bma-rishi-sunak-rail-unions-live-news">reported</a>. More backlash ensued, and now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/09/barclay-agreed-to-discuss-lump-sum-or-back-pay-for-nhs-workers-say-sources">more strikes.</a> &ldquo;Show talks between Ministers and trade union leaders representing striking staff will backfire on an incompetent, provocative Tory Government when they were nothing more than a poor PR stunt,&rdquo; spat an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tories-responsible-strikes-refuse-start-28913853">editorial</a> posted Monday by the Daily Mirror.</p>

                <p>Let us pray it backfires, and soon.&nbsp;&#9632;</p>
