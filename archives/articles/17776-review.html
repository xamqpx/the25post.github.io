          <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">&ldquo;S</inline>omething is terribly wrong,&rdquo; a seemingly normal article about the future of the N.F.L. reads. &ldquo;Something is terribly wrong. Something is terribly wrong. Something is terribly wrong.&rdquo; The words start flying at you, the page disintegrates. &ldquo;Something is terribly wrong. Something is terribly wrong. Something is terribly wrong.&rdquo; And the screen turns black. You&rsquo;re pretty sure you&rsquo;ve been hacked. Then a message appears: &ldquo;Good morning. The time is: 2:17 a.m. The date is 3-27-43.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>So begins &ldquo;17776&rdquo; (2017), the twenty-five-chapter multimedia speculative fiction by American sports writer Jon Bois. The series follows, among many others, a sentient Pioneer 9 (&ldquo;Nine&rdquo;) navigating the drastic changes of a world (i.e., an America &mdash; the laughably typical Americanist equivalence) where people have simply stopped dying or getting sick. The subplots which Nine, in turn, follows are so many and so all-encompassing, despite all being about football, that it&rsquo;s almost dizzying. But if anything, that&rsquo;s the point. There is nothing normal about playing a football game on a field spanning from Mexico to Canada for thirteen thousand years, stuck in an impossibly deep gorge in Arizona, just because they&rsquo;re petty and they can. There is nothing normal about a 500 game where people shoot steel footballs from a cannon on Denali to the continental United States, just because they&rsquo;re petty and they can. There is nothing normal about building skyscrapers on a football field after a Broncos vs. Steelers game went south. Just because they&rsquo;re petty and they can. There is no other appropriate reaction than to be disoriented, confused, and constantly asking &mdash; as Nine did &mdash; &ldquo;WHY?&rdquo;</p>
          
          <p>In many ways &ldquo;17776&rdquo; is absurdist: Bois crafts his extensive American football knowledge into narratives that are so blown out and downright comical they&rsquo;re almost hard to believe. Keyword: almost. You find yourself laughing at the sheer audacity of these people just playing football for millennia, but, as you scroll through the GIFs and text and YouTube videos that make up each chapter, there&rsquo;s an element of truth that sticks to you. You imagine yourself, also in that hypothetical world where people just stopped dying in 2026, and all social ills have been eliminated, and struggle and desire, the subjects of thousands of years of philosophy, are supposedly irrelevant artifacts. Endless consumption, endless leisure &mdash; the logical ends of capitalism and the industrial revolution. Given these conditions, the solutions that humans came up with in &ldquo;17776&rdquo; feel entirely normal; in fact, they feel utopic, and you wonder how these people haven&rsquo;t degraded into violence anyway, despite the absence of social ills. But this utopia never fixes any of the things we face as people, as sentient beings: anger, loneliness, a need for purpose, a need for change, for evolution. And so, struggle and desire continue, eternally irreconcilable.</p>
          
          <p>It&rsquo;s worth acknowledging that capitalist critique was never Bois&rsquo; intention (&ldquo;The goal as conceived was to give the reader a good time,&rdquo; he said in an interview. &ldquo;That was literally the whole point.&quot;) but it was an inevitable consequence. The despicably unique flavor of American late-stage capitalism, with its enticing flavors of freedom, self-importance, and complete disregard for its negative effects on the environment and the world at large, is unfortunately the reality for the likely vast majority of Bois&rsquo; readers. And he doesn&rsquo;t shy away from that fact, either; he dedicates an entire chapter to showing a submerged New York City (animated from edited Google Earth satellite images), most likely caused by rising sea levels due to climate change, as witty dialogue explains that people simply accepted this as their new reality and started playing football there, too, underwater.</p>
          
          <p>They say capitalism breeds innovation; but at the literal end of time, the need for innovation is gone, and society devolves into an endless routine of consumerism and, in Nine&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;perpetually hanging out&rdquo; &mdash; even if that hanging-out spot is the now-submerged financial capital of the world.</p>
          
          <p>There&rsquo;s a line that sticks out to me the most (besides the insanely accurate references to Livermore, California that made me feel unexpectedly seen), where Pioneer 10 (&ldquo;Ten&rdquo;) is telling Nine about the &ldquo;forgotten lawns&rdquo;: the patches of land on which, even after 13,000 years of immortality, people have never even thought to step foot. &ldquo;you know who would've wandered out there? just to do it?&rdquo; Ten asks. And they both know the answer. &ldquo;Children.&rdquo;</p>
