                <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">E</inline>veryone has a dream, a purpose, a reason, a promise or motivation in life to fulfill. It&rsquo;s what drives us to continue living, so that we may one day achieve the yearning ambition that lurks in the back of our heads, reminding us of its existence. Some go mad and chase it to the point of leaving everything they&rsquo;ve developed behind, because they know it just feels right.</p>

                <p><i>La La Land</i>, a staple of writer-director Damien Chazelle &mdash; frequently compared alongside <i>Whiplash</i> (2014) &mdash; is a cry out to those who have a dream. It may not be a self-help novel on how to fix your mindset, but it is, rather, the shared experience of two lovers struggling to find meaning in the world as they risk everything to be happy. This is where the beauty of the film lies.</p>

                <p><i>La La Land</i> is the story of two star-crossed lovers bound together by one thing: the dream of making it. There&rsquo;s Mia (Emma Stone), a barista working in the Warner Brothers lot, waiting for the day she can quit her job and make her acting debut; and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a musician whose life, invigorated by the free-form spirit of jazz, wishes to open his own club. After fate brings the two together in a road rage-related altercation, Mia and Seb would continue to run into each other, and their shared desire to fulfill that dream, in the end, sparks a romance. </p>

                <p>The pair are inseparable; they are both driven by that same force, the commitment they made to drop everything and try and do what they fantasized of doing their entire lives. They cheer each other on; they both help make their aspirations come true. Seb lets Mia wear his polyester &mdash; or was it wool? &mdash; suit to an audition, and even convinces her to write her own one-woman play. With Mia&rsquo;s encouragement, Seb starts playing regularly with a jazz band headed by John Legend (as himself).</p>

                <p>The viewer can&rsquo;t help but feel proud of the relationship the two have built for each other; Mia and Seb have no fears and dreams of making it are no longer out of reach for them.</p>

                <p>Until suddenly, it all stops.</p>

                <p>Mia grows frustrated, telling Seb that his commitment to his band was preventing him from pursuing opening the jazz club. Mia wishes that Seb would go back to his roots, and felt that he was losing himself on his path. On the debut of Mia&rsquo;s play, no one shows up &mdash; including Seb, who chose to do a photoshoot instead. Their never-ending desire to try and do what they love &mdash; the one thing that binds them &mdash; ends their relationship.</p>

                <p>After Mia leaves Los Angeles to live back at home, Seb convinces her to drive back for one final audition, where she gives the performance of a lifetime. Five years later, Mia has made it &mdash; but is married to another man. Mia and her husband end up stumbling into a jazz club, and wouldn&rsquo;t you believe it, it&rsquo;s the one Seb promised himself to create. Seb punches out another emotional performance of &ldquo;Mia &amp; Sebastian&rsquo;s Theme&rdquo; on piano &mdash; and, for a brief moment, we see the good ending. Mia and Seb get married, have children, Mia is still a famous actress, Seb a celebrated jazz musician, all their dreams come true, just the way we wanted &mdash; and the song is over. Back in reality, Seb and Mia, at opposite ends of the venue, share a brief, knowing glance. Then Mia leaves. </p>

                <p>I&rsquo;ll admit, immediately after finishing the film, I was furious. Mia and Seb had everything going for them, I thought; they were going to make it and settle down and grow old together! It left this bittersweet taste in my mouth. But this was no accident, as Chazelle makes clear. We are given a glimpse into the ideal world that had been teased to us in the first half of the film. But as Seb sits next to Mia, watching the jazz performance &mdash; violating a continuity with reality &mdash; we are reminded once again that the true path of their lives were meant to be at opposite ends.</p>

                <p>But how far did our two lovers actually get while they were together? Seb&rsquo;s dream of opening a jazz club was slipping away from him as he committed to play in the band, and Mia&rsquo;s confidence as an actress was crippled as she failed to attract an audience to her play. Viewers can try to draw up solutions to &ldquo;make things work&rdquo; for them, but it is mutually understood for Mia and Seb that staying together would not allow them to live the life they truly wished to. So, understandably, they both went their separate ways.</p>

                <p>A concept with which I continue to obsess myself is amatonormativity. Coined in 2012 by the <a href="https://elizabethbrake.com/amatonormativity/">American philosopher Elizabeth Brake</a>, amatonormativity refers to the idea that a romantic relationship &ldquo;is normative, in that it should be aimed at in preference to other relationship types.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s something I struggle with all the time when watching films. I root for romance and I want it to happen more than anything else in the film. When Mia and Seb&rsquo;s romance falls through, I can&rsquo;t handle the thought of their futures actually working out. I prioritize their romance over the real reason they left everything behind.</p>

                <p>Slavoj &#381;i&#382;ek describes the paradox of romance perfectly. In his own <a href="https://thephilosophicalsalon.com/la-la-land-a-leninist-reading/">Leninist reading of the film</a>, published 2017 in The Philosophical Salon, &#381;i&#382;ek writes that &ldquo;love, precisely as the Absolute, should not be posited as a direct goal. It should retain the status of a by-product, of something we get as an undeserved grace.&rdquo; If Mia and Seb were to have their cake and eat it too, the film would fail to portray an accurate lived experience.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;Perhaps, there is no greater love than that of a revolutionary couple,&rdquo; &#381;i&#382;ek writes, &ldquo;where each of the two lovers is ready to abandon the other at any moment if revolution demands it.&rdquo; We see Chazelle provide a refreshing take on romance in film, producing that ideal revolutionary couple that &#381;i&#382;ek idealizes &mdash; the pair whom, despite an enduring affection, but without fear, will part ways for a greater purpose.</p>

                <p>I think we all have a little piece of Mia and Seb within us. Mia and Seb did not get the married life I wished they did, and well, that&rsquo;s okay. No one knows what&rsquo;s coming for us or what the future looks like, but all we can do is try our best to construct the timeline that works best for us. And that means following your dreams, chasing your ambitions, and fulfilling your goals, but also knowing that they may not come true exactly how you imagined &mdash; and that&rsquo;s totally fine.</p>

                <p>So here&rsquo;s to the ones who dream, foolish as they may seem.&nbsp;&#9632;</p>
