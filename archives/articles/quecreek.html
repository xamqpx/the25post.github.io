                <p><span class="padded-dropcap">I</span> am not a coal miner, nor is anyone in my family. I expect this is true for most readers. Much of my dubious knowledge of mining comes from films: a young man who dreams of leaving his hometown, but has to drop out of high school to work in the mine when his father is injured on the job; Norte&ntilde;o union miners who go out on strike for equality with Anglo miners and their wives who continue the strike when an injunction bars the miners from picketing.</p>

                <p>But film is not the only form of art that portrays coal mining. From the hills of Northumberland and Wales to Canada and Kentucky, there have been countless songs written by coal miners and their families, as well as professional musicians. The travails of coal mining have, and continue to be, a popular subject of folk songs, which are perhaps the oldest art genre in the world.</p>

                <p>I came into the American folk genre in 2020, with Pete Seeger&rsquo;s labor ballads catching the ear of my newly radical anticapitalism, stoked in the face of pandemic, climate change, school budget cuts &mdash; no doubt a familiar story. It turned out the taste for folk music runs in my family &mdash; my mother had attended a few of Seeger&rsquo;s concerts back in the day &mdash; further driving my interest. The genre tells the stories of, well, folks, both ordinary and mythical in America over the last century and more. Both the anachronisms of everyday life past and present and the stories told by faraway communities sing out to me in this music. There&rsquo;s something beautiful in the simplicity of those everyday folk songs which capture a piece of humanity.</p>

                <p>Perhaps the best-known folk song of the working man is &ldquo;John Henry.&rdquo; Despite not being about coal mining, I would be remiss not to include it in any history of folk song. &ldquo;John Henry&rdquo; tells the story of a Black railroad worker who went head-to-head with a steam drill and won &mdash; the emblematic song of man versus machine. &ldquo;John Henry&rdquo; songs, with dozens of alternative verses, functioned as work songs &mdash; a foundation of blues which sets the pace for a work team &mdash; in which case the tale aptly serves as a cautionary message to not work too hard, and as ballads lamenting ego, the danger of railroad work, the expendability and spirit of labor, Jim Crow codes, and exploitation. Many of these themes are commonly found in other folk songs.</p>

                <p>A song which offers strong insight into the life and labor of the coal miner is &ldquo;Dark as a Dungeon,&rdquo; the 1946 song by Merle Travis &mdash; the son of a coal miner turned songwriter &mdash; which was later made widely famous by Johnny Cash. The song is formatted as a warning from a lifelong miner to a group of young men to avoid his career. Slow, smooth, and memorably accented, the song is easy to pick up and sing at a whim. The light guitar and clear vocals contrast with the chilling lyrics of the dark and strenuous work of the mine, and the addicting hold it has on many a miner. It seems incredible to me that a man would, for forty years, work five days a week in a coal mine; but this song helps to explain why so many did. And indeed, for many people, there isn&rsquo;t much of a choice when you grow up in a company town where everyone works in the mines.</p>

                <br><br>

                <p><span class="padded-dropcap">I</span> could write a book on the ways in which coal mining, industrial capitalism, and folk music intersect. Dozens of songs cover miners&rsquo; strikes and labor struggles &mdash; even just with regards to coal mining one can find songs from eighteen-nineties Kentucky all the way up through nineteen-eighties England. In <i>The Birth of Tragedy</i>, Friedrich Nietzsche wrote: &ldquo;In song and in dance man expresses himself as a member of a higher community; he has forgotten how to walk and speak and is on the way to flying into the air, dancing... He is no longer an artist, he has become a work of art.&rdquo; In contrast, music in the modern era is commodified and consumed, rather than existing as art. We still derive beauty from listening to music, yes, but largely mediated through genre &mdash; itself a perversion of community &mdash; and the music industry as consumers, rather than as artist and audience.</p>

                <p>Even folk music grapples with this colonization by capitalism; despite this, the character of folk music is such that it resists commodification. By nature, it is a communal art form: written, sung, changed around, and listened to every day in every part of the world in lullabies, ballads, and slices of life in song. No definitive version of any given song exists, with countless variants of popular folk songs in existence. The closest a folk song can come to commodification is a recording of a specific rendition. (A similar process does happen with commercial music, where popular versions sell better, but there is a qualitative difference between songs produced for such a purpose and those that are understood as another contribution to a rich history of collective creation.)</p>

                <p>In this sense, folk music is better understood as a cultural process rather than by abstract musical categories. In other words, folk music is simply what the people sing, and thus impossible to pin down. In our contemporary advertisement-saturated culture, it can serve to remind us of the nature of music as a collective art.</p>

                <p>Folk music about coal mining is still being written to this day. In 2004, Ana&iuml;s Mitchell, best known for her Tony Award-winning musical Hadestown, released her second album, &ldquo;Hymns for the Exiled,&rdquo; an indie folk album grappling with themes ranging from the Iraq war to gender politics.</p>

                <p>With American war mania (hope)fully buried after twenty years in the Middle East, the antiwar sentiment permeating throughout Mitchell&rsquo;s album is now far less controversial. But for 2004, the heart of the second Bush presidency, &ldquo;Hymns&rdquo; was distinctly provocative and unpatriotic. As Jon Lusk wrote for the B.B.C. in 2008, &ldquo;If she'd been any more mainstream or, say, a country artist, &lsquo;Hymns For The Exiled&rsquo; might have inspired the kind of right-wing backlash suffered by The Dixie Chicks after their comments about the Iraq war in March 2003.&rdquo; Despite not bucking the political theme, against the rest of the album, track 8, titled &ldquo;Quecreek Flood,&rdquo; is something of the odd one out.</p>

                <br><br>

                <p><span class="padded-dropcap">I</span>n 2002, seventy-five million gallons of water flooded the Quecreek Mine in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, trapping nine miners underground. The rescue operation took over three days. All of the miners survived, but media coverage and investigation of Quecreek largely failed to reckon with the very tangible political and economic factors of the disaster, instead focusing on the triumph of the rescue itself and not root causes beyond the mine&rsquo;s geography.</p>

                <p>The truth was that the Quecreek disaster was years in the making: the Bush Administration&rsquo;s 2001 budget proposal cut funding for the Mine Safety and Health Administration, which subsequently decreased enforcement of safety regulations and programs aimed at detection of black lung disease, and Quecreek miners were intimidated away from organizing by the mine contractor, even as their protections were slashed and their working conditions deteriorated. Two years after the incident, Mitchell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Quecreek Flood&rdquo; brought these systemic causes into the spotlight, which so often go ignored in our media discourse, and indicted the news media in doing so.</p>

                <p>A folk singer in her own right and the daughter of counterculture academics, Mitchell is no doubt familiar with the singers of the sixties&rsquo; folk revival, including Peggy Seeger and Ewan MacColl, who wrote &ldquo;The Ballad of Springhill,&rdquo; a song eulogizing the cave-in of 1958 in the Nova Scotia town of Springhill, where seventy-five coal miners died. Seeger and MacColl&rsquo;s solemn message is encapsulated in the lyric: &ldquo;Bone and blood is the price of coal.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t seem much of a stretch to say that &ldquo;Quecreek Flood&rdquo; is one part tribute to &ldquo;The Ballad of Springhill.&rdquo;</p>

                <video title="Ewan MacColl, Peggy Seeger: &ldquo;The Ballad of Springhill&rdquo;" width="100%" height="400" controls poster="../uploads/quecreek-the-ballad-of-springhill-cover.jpg" style="background-color: #000;">

                </video>

                <p>Another part is more subtle, but is likewise connected to the &ldquo;Ballad.&rdquo; When I listen to &ldquo;Quecreek Flood,&rdquo; I hear how Mitchell&rsquo;s knowledge of the Springhill tragedy shapes the meanings of the lyrics. I hear of our society&rsquo;s relative value of human life, profit, and media, and a condemnation that in the nearly half-century between Springhill and Quecreek, nothing about industrial capitalism&rsquo;s disregard for human life has changed except for the lights and the cameras.</p>

                <br><br>

                <p><span class="padded-dropcap">N</span>o one should have to sing &ldquo;Quecreek Flood.&rdquo; Not forty-six years after Springhill, or the countless mining disasters in the decades since, not when it could have been prevented &mdash; we could have stopped it. But neither does it seem that industrial capitalism can quit its addiction to coal nor other subterranean minerals, and so accidents will inevitably continue. Despite the fact that US coal mining has been on the decline since 2008, on average thirty coal miners die every year on the job as of 2019, to say nothing of the effects of black lung, emphysema, toxic runoff, air pollution, or carbon dioxide emissions on miners, mining communities, and the biosphere at large.</p>
                <p>Coal is on the way out in America: with coal-based heating all but eradicated and coal-burning power plants shutting down every year, US coal mining might be a thing of the past as soon as 2030. Despite the objective need to leave existing coal deposits in the ground in the face of climate change, anxiety surrounding job loss among miners and mining communities is a very understandable reaction. This is yet another theme that crops up regularly in the folk genre, unsurprisingly surrounding automation and deindustrialization &mdash; what will happen to the workers whose labor built and maintained our lifestyle once they are no longer needed, and their communities &mdash; along with the music that is a part of them &mdash; disperse and decay?&nbsp;&#9632;</p>
