          <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">T</inline>his is not an article about Ketanji Brown Jackson.</p>

          <p>The chaos in the Senate over the past few weeks has never been about Ketanji Brown Jackson. The exhaustive media coverage of her hearings and confirmation was never about Ketanji Brown Jackson. President Joe Biden&rsquo;s choice to nominate her in the first place was never about Ketanji Brown Jackson.</p>
          
          <p>It was about diversity optics, and that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
          
          <p>Before I delve further, I realize my argument warrants several disclaimers: first, there is no doubt that Jackson&rsquo;s nomination is historic. As the New York Times et al. have endlessly parroted, the highest court in the land finally reflects the diversity which the United States holds as its greatest source of pride. Second, it is evident &mdash; given both her curriculum vitae and Republican attempts to hurl empty-headed poorly-disguised ad hominems during hearings &mdash; that Jackson is more than qualified for the position she will soon fill, regardless of her race. Again, this is not an article about Ketanji Brown Jackson. (I must credit Linda Greenhouse from The Atlantic for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/court-ketanji-brown-jackson-knew/627096/">this opening sentence</a>.)</p>
          
          <p>Jackson&rsquo;s future, at least in the short-term, is clear, Adam Liptak wrote for the New York Times: filing futile dissents in the &ldquo;court&rsquo;s rightward march&rdquo; as it addresses pivotal cases threatening affirmative action and gay rights. When she replaces Breyer in the summer, the 6-3 supermajority delighting Republicans and infuriating Democrats will remain entirely untouched.</p>
          
          <p>So what was the point of all of this anyway?</p>
          
          <p>As this year&rsquo;s midterms approach, the Biden administration and his Democratic Party have their interest piqued in saving face however they can. The one influential promise Biden&rsquo;s campaign put forth during the 2020 election, the Build Back Better bill, is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/14/dems-2022-build-back-better-527096">constantly being stalled</a> &mdash; and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/joe-manchin-kills-the-build-back-better-bill">Democrats</a> <a href="https://www.axios.com/sinema-gives-last-rites-to-bbb-6c830312-2cf3-4b90-9665-2b2e22cde08b.html">have</a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/11/you-will-see-the-wrath-progressives-warn-biden-against-cutting-down-agenda-00016752">no one</a> but themselves to blame. National vaccination efforts, initiated by the Trump administration with Operation Warp speed, were mostly managed under Biden. Only 65% of Americans are fully vaccinated (77% have received at least one dose); the administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/10/14/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-covid-19-response-and-vaccination-program-2/">blames misinformation campaigns</a> which it cannot, and therefore will not, mitigate. Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine is only fanning the fire: unable to take direct action, Biden is turning to heavier and heavier sanctions driving <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/07/energy/record-gas-price/index.html">record gas price hikes</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/05/big-oil-companies-are-using-wartime-profits-enrich-investors-report-says/">enriching fossil fuel companies</a> at a pivotal era for climate change reform.</p>
          
          <p>Biden is running out of options, so he has turned to the one promise he can fulfill at this point: putting diverse people in power. Biden has promised to create the &ldquo;most diverse cabinet&rdquo; in American history, and to his credit, he has succeeded in that. So far, Biden&rsquo;s Cabinet has employed one of the highest percentages in non-white and non-male members. Several Cabinet members have made history for being firsts as openly gay, Native American, Black, Latinx, et cetera.</p>
          
          <p>With Jackson, Biden extends his holy mission of diversity beyond the Cabinet. The media will laud her confirmation as the first Black woman to serve as a Supreme Court justice. As established earlier, the current untouchable supermajority means her impact is realistically minimal, if existent whatsoever; but what happens in the courtroom is hardly in Biden&rsquo;s interest. What matters to his administration is that Jackson was confirmed, and their face is saved.</p>
          
          <p>Meanwhile, Jackson&rsquo;s nomination process has forcibly reopened wounds for Black women across the country. The <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-culture-wars-couldnt-stop-ketanji-brown-jacksons-confirmation/">unreasonable</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/03/23/cruz-jackson-hearing-critical-race-theory-school/">baseless</a> scrutiny Jackson faced during so-called hearings were a painful reminder of the discrimination Black women and women of color face in workplaces of all kinds &mdash; despite their qualifications, despite their proven (and unnecessary to prove) intelligence, despite their hard work. It was arguably an unnecessary reminder: pundits, and probably the Biden administration as well, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/21/1087718808/ketanji-brown-jacksons-long-judicial-record-is-likely-to-be-scrutinized-at-heari">knew</a> the confirmation process would be strictly partisan, and that Republicans would resort to the lowest slanderous attacks in their baseless attempts to invalidate the nominee. But to Biden, such traumatizing attacks are not a systemic issue to be solved, but a necessary evil to get a historic achievement on paper.</p>
          
          <p>Put simply, a president who <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/05/25/statement-by-president-joe-biden-on-the-first-anniversary-of-george-floyds-murder/">promised to address systemic racism</a> is not only <a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/22/us-police-reform-bill-congress-bipartisan-talks">stalling actual efforts to enact reform</a>, but also exploiting it for media attention and public support.</p>
          
          <p>This is the unspoken consequence of Ketanji Brown Jackson&rsquo;s confirmation. If it wasn&rsquo;t clear before, it&rsquo;s clear now: the Biden administration, despite all his diversity optics, thinks systemic racism is a fact of life. He will not fix it; he will not care to fix it.</p>
