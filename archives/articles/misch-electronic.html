          <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">W</inline>hat set Tom Misch apart from the crowd was the brainwashing. Find one good lick, and run it to the ground. Repeat it five times, and it becomes part of the rhythm. Repeat it a hundred times, and it becomes part of your system.</p>
          <p>It makes concerts all the more easier, too. The London producer hardly ever announces the name of the next song in his set; there&apos;s simply no need to. He plays the one lick and the crowd goes wild.</p>
          <p>Which makes house music, what with its obsession with samples and loops, especially enticing for Misch. In an interview with <em>Huck&nbsp;</em>magazine, Misch said he set a rule for himself: &quot;No guitar.&quot; And it&apos;s true that guitar is the most identifiable pieces in the neatly fitting puzzle of his soundscape. But it&apos;s not just the guitar; it&apos;s how he plays it. Over and over again. The same thing. And this album is no different, just that the repetition isn&apos;t in the guitar, it&apos;s in the sample. &quot;Singin&apos; happy music, singin&apos; happy music&quot; drills into the beat and the skull until it becomes a part of the happy music.</p>
          <p>What sets this release apart from the others, beyond the repetitive device, is the drums. Whereas Tom Misch mastered the laid-back chill-stoner groove, Supershy demands more. The kick is aggressive, the snare is sharp. Saw synths cut through softer sounds to drive the beat even further forward. The fundamentals of house - with some differences. The beat is controlled but acoustic. Drums had also been a focus with his previous album,<em>&nbsp;What Kinda Music</em>. Yussef Dayes added an energy impossible to recreate, at least in the jazz context, with his live recordings. Now Misch, with his brainwashing talents, is challenging the British house throne; and soon enough he&apos;ll be sitting atop it.</p>
          <p>All in all, the Supershy release feels less like a magnum opus and more a taste of the things to come. Misch patiently eases his jazz-entrenched listeners into his new world, calling with his own recorded voice: &quot;something on my mind, something on my mind, something on my mind...&quot;</p>
          <p>Despite the alter ego, it&apos;s still undeniably Tom Misch - for now.</p>
