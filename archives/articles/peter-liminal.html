          <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">P</inline>eter Liu might as well not exist.</p>
<p>When I first met him, it was by sheer chance: third grade, at an underfunded elementary school squeezed into a middle-class suburb. I looked up from my arts and crafts project to see him being escorted out to the principal&rsquo;s office. Something about a pair of scissors.</p>
<p>In tenth grade, when I saw him again, he was silent. The little he did say, even to be funny, seemed calculated to reveal nothing about his own character. I feared his silence, but I also respected it. Some people say too much. Saying too little was the better of the two extremes.</p>
<p>We had our own circles back then; dragged in by their gravity, opportunities for collision were too few and far between. In college, though, those circles disappeared. Everyone in high school left for every which way, to be stranded and left to their own devices at campuses that tried their hardest to pretend to be welcoming. He and I were stranded here, at the University of Southern California, a maze of brick walls and vague Ancient Greek imagery and peace signs.</p>
<p>Like everyone else, we tried escaping. Secluded away in his own dorm room, he fussed over his Wacom and his matcha-colored keyboard, drawing and posting content for a Twitter audience of just under five hundred. I sat at my computer for hours on end, starting projects I knew I couldn&rsquo;t finish, throwing copies of my half-baked resume into this job and that internship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At some point, though, you learn to embrace your new home. When I first toured the university back in April 2021, I wasn&rsquo;t all that fascinated with the omnipresent red brick; it was overwhelming, even brash. It took me six months of walking down Trousdale to look up from my phone and accept that maybe this place had its good architectural moments. Maybe he felt the same way too.</p>
<p>One of the defining features of the university is a metal skeleton of a globe, whose red-brick pedestal looms over the Center for International and Public Affairs (which will be renamed 11 April in honor of Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow). The people I know call it something else, seeing as the tower is decidedly phallic.</p>
<p>In late February, he caught the globe under golden-hour light and took a picture from underneath. He showed it to me.&nbsp;</p>
<img class="center" src="../PETER2 25POST.jpg">
<p>I still couldn&rsquo;t tell you what exactly it is that I loved about it. Maybe it&rsquo;s that I don&rsquo;t have the technical language to analyze it. Maybe there&rsquo;s something to say about the darker foreground that cages in the timidly bright globe in the midground. Maybe it was the fact that the photo was from a completely different angle.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t find myself accepting any of those explanations. It was more of a feeling that hit me: I felt small. I felt a longing for the quiet in this moment caught on camera, a desire to inhabit that otherwise completely unpopulated space. To be alone.</p>
<p>I tried copying him. I found the same location, the same angle. But it didn&rsquo;t quite feel the same. There was a layer that felt missing.</p>
<p>On March 3, he made a separate Instagram account for archiving his photographs. His first post was the globe. His second post was of the Gateway Column, near the north entrance along Jefferson.&nbsp;</p>
<img class="center" src="../PETER3 25POST.jpg">

<p>He has a talent for finding barren spaces. He briefly flirted with chairs:</p>
<img class="center" src="../PETER1 25POST.jpg">

<p>Utterly devoid of people, shadows, movement, or any sign of life, the foldable chairs float off of the page, questioning your vision, doubting your senses. You&rsquo;ve been here before. I&rsquo;ve been here before. But never like this.</p>
<img class="center" src="../PETER LIU 25POST.jpg">

<p>A liminal space thrives when the image is one you think you can recognize, but you can&apos;t tell exactly. But Liu takes on a different task entirely: naming the liminal, and calling it home. A place devoid of its place-ness.&nbsp;</p>
<img class="center" src="../PETER425POST.jpg">

<p>Lately, Liu seems to be warming up again to the thought of people existing in his surrealist universe. Even as life pretends to not exist, signs of life intrude on his otherwise unidentifiable landscapes:</p>
<img class="center" src="../PETER5 25POST.jpg">

<p>It could just be a coincidence that the pandemic is easing up here in the United States, and we&apos;re slowly learning how to live again under the glaring eyes of other people everywhere all the time. The world is a large, cold, and daunting place, but Liu captures the warmth of other people that we miss in isolation.</p>
