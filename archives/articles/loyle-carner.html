          <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">B</inline>en Coyle-Larner (Loyle Carner) is one of those unforgettable artists that you almost forget and then remember again &mdash; one of those who traverse the front and back of your mind in a years-long round-trip, but never leave as you imagine others do. In the off-times &mdash; the two or three years where he fades out of the limelight, as quickly and silently as he faded in, to ponder on his Blackness, his fame, his soul, the great questions and almost-answers swirling in his mind &mdash; you miss him, but you don&rsquo;t find yourself looking for him.</p>
          <p>Kendrick Lamar is an immediate comparison that comes to mind: he appears, sends waves and ripples through the music world; collects the awards, the praises, the critics, the hate, the what-ifs; then disappears again, pondering, wondering, creating. But Lamar&rsquo;s status is one where, even as the world turns without him, it still turns with him too. &ldquo;<a href="https://oklama.com/nuthoughts" style="color:white" target="_blank"><u>While the world around me evolves, I reflect on what matters the most. The life in which my words will land next.</u></a>&rdquo; The discourse never stopped. Before he even put a single word into the public eye, before he shared the Instagram post that broke the Internet for the day: &ldquo;Appreciate Your Patience.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Even as the release date dropped for his new album &ldquo;Hugo,&rdquo; this coming October, I find myself feeling a different kind of excited: a reserved kind, that makes me eager to wait and entirely unable to wait for those two long months. A healthy kind of excited. And it seems that&rsquo;s what Carner wants from you too, if his routine promotional material on Instagram is anything to go by. The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ChaaHIYjRyl/?hl=en" style="color:white" target="_blank"><u>video</u></a> he uploaded 18 August to announce the date is a single-take handheld shot of him driving up, muffled radio noise and all, then on a poster reading &ldquo;hugo&rdquo; he quickly adds with a marker: &ldquo;21.10.22.&rdquo; Then he leaves. A brief glimpse of music and art and life, gone in an instant.</p>
          <p>For lack of a better-fitting term, Carner is distinctly chill. But he&rsquo;s also painfully honest. Even from &ldquo;Tierney Terrace&rdquo; (2015), that much was immediately obvious: his sound is where jazz meets grime, and fronting vocals deliver sensitive confessionals. Lyrics flow so gently through the ear that you almost don&rsquo;t notice the words: &ldquo;woes, decompose, muddy clothes and a runny nose / Flows, we&rsquo;re shivering, she mistakes it for giggling / Mother quivering hopping out the seat that she&rsquo;s sitting in.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>I found him through Tom Misch (the English singer-songwriter-<a href="https://the25post.com/archives/articles/misch-electronic" style="color:white" target="_blank"><u>turned-disco-producer</u></a>), during the latter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Geography&rdquo; era. I idolized (and continue to idolize) Misch, and the intersection of jazz, funk, and dizzying nostalgia on which he sat; and something about the way Carner&rsquo;s several features on his tracks blended in so effortlessly forced my hand. Carner knows his niche to a T, and his Spotify profile becomes a pipeline for even the below-average British jazz scene enthusiast. In &ldquo;Ottolenghi&rdquo; (named after Yotam, the Israeli-born British chef), Jordan Rakei offers a humble backdrop as Carner speaks, as if from a diary, &ldquo;remedy and lust don&rsquo;t hold any memories of us / Rather hold you every day until the memories are dust.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Mean It In The Morning,&rdquo; a guitar murmurs over churning snares, &ldquo;lines that were mine, kissing on that cold spine / Love was all and hopeless &lsquo;fore I focused on that co-sign,&rdquo; and I want it to be 2017 again and to be in a home that never was while rain patters on the windows.</p>
          <p style="color:grey">Read: <u><a href="https://the25post.com/archives/articles/misch-electronic" style="color:grey" target="_blank">Tom Misch goes electronic</a></u></p>
          <p>What makes Carner stand out is the feeling of finding a stranger&rsquo;s notebook on the bus, parsing through a dense, decontextualized, endlessly complex life entirely separate from your own &mdash; the feeling of sonder, as it were. Sonder, though, fails to capture the difference between the coincidental realization which it describes, and the aching derealization of having someone&rsquo;s life in front of you on a silver platter. The feeling of wishing for something, and knowing and not knowing what that something is. That, to me, is Loyle Carner.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Hugo&rdquo; releases on all platforms on 21 October. In the meantime, Carner has two new singles: &ldquo;Georgetown&rdquo; (feat. John Agard) and &ldquo;Hate&rdquo;.</p>
