      <p style="color:grey;"><i>This article contains significant spoilers for seasons one through six of </i>Better Call Saul<i> and seasons one through five of </i>Breaking Bad<i>.</i></p>

      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">I</span>n short, this is a completely unbiased love letter to Rhea Seehorn. That her sheer talent as an actor shaped and molded the arc of AMC&rsquo;s multi-award-winning <i>Better Call Saul</i> is just about the most reported trivia about the show. Eighty percent of the plot and characters have at least some connection to <i>Breaking Bad</i>, the show&rsquo;s mega-hit predecessor; but Seehorn, in playing the smart, witty attorney Kim Wexler, had to start from scratch. Before Seehorn, Kim was only to serve as a love interest and morality/reality check for the star of the show, Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk). After Seehorn, she becomes a full-fledged character whose moral complexity is equally as nail-biting as the downright atrocities her partner commits. &ldquo;Kim Wexler has the greatest poker face of any character I&rsquo;ve ever seen,&rdquo; writer-director Peter Gould <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-showrunner-final-season-bryan-cranston-aaron-paul-1235195756/">told The Hollywood Reporter in August</a>. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s somebody who knows when to stay silent instead of speaking her mind, but while this character can conceal her thoughts from the other characters in the scene, we in the audience can see everything that&rsquo;s going on in her. It&rsquo;s a magic trick that is remarkable.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Having seen <i>Breaking Bad</i>, my expectation for Kim was inevitably a parallel to Skyler White (Anna Gunn): the smart moral-high-ground wife who can neither be fooled nor persuaded into being complicit with her husband&rsquo;s criminal activities. Skyler is often seen as the most hated character in the show: objectively, her reactions to Walter White&rsquo;s (Bryan Cranston) meth imperialism were more than appropriate, but audiences&rsquo; manufactured sympathy for the deadbeat cancer patient/high school chemistry teacher &mdash; in addition to Skyler being a woman &mdash; resulted in her being perceived as the &ldquo;nagging wife&rdquo; but ten times worse. Fans lamented, with varying degrees of irony, just how much Walter could have accomplished had Skyler simply stayed out of the way. &ldquo;The consensus among the haters was clear: Skyler was a ball-and-chain, a drag, a shrew, an &lsquo;annoying bitch wife,&rsquo;&rdquo; wrote Gunn in a 2013 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/opinion/i-have-a-character-issue.html">New York Times op-ed</a>. (Especially disgruntled viewers also sent death threats to Gunn.)</p>

      <img src="https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/skyler-white.jpg">

      <p>I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if Kim was a direct response to those viewers &mdash; even if not deliberately so. She is the antithesis to Skyler: a (literal) partner in crime, no doubt with reservations but always willing to defend Jimmy and clean up his mistakes, even if it means marrying him just to secure spousal privilege. Their relationship is, in fact, directly dependent on the success and frequency of their various schemes. (See, for example, how they grow distant when Kim devotes her time to Schweikart &amp; Cokely and her pro bono work, or how they make love as their smear campaign against Howard succeeds.) To root for this couple means to root for their crimes. With <i>Breaking Bad</i>, viewers at least had the wimpy sympathy defense in rooting for Walter&rsquo;s drug empire. In <i>Better Call Saul</i>, there is no such thing: we only revel in the pure evil, with the added bonus of a rom-com side arc.</p>

      <p>Viewers got what they wanted. Now what?</p>

      <p>Consequences. With Vince Gilligan, it&rsquo;s always been about consequences; and even with Peter Gould now in as co-creator and Gilligan out of the picture for two of the six seasons, that much has stayed consistent. It&rsquo;s much more apparent in <i>Breaking Bad</i>: at every wrong turn, either someone dies, or a relationship sours beyond repair, or Walter gets kicked out of his home or his job. We see it as early as the cold open of the pilot episode: Walt, wearing nothing but underwear, veers an R.V. into an open desert road, with two bodies in the trailer and another guy collapsed in the passenger seat. It only takes a fifty-minute episode to get from a life-altering cancer diagnosis to &#8230; that.</p>

      <p>In <i>Better Call Saul</i>, it takes six seasons &mdash; at least in Kim&rsquo;s world. Slowly but surely, Kim allows herself to become the same con-man Jimmy is. At first, the cons are harmless; they hunker down at a top-of-the-line restaurant or bar, ready to pounce on any high-flying, self-righteous investor willing to lose a few grand so long as they get something in return. But Jimmy gets bolder, and the cons start to creep uncomfortably close to home. The first time, it&rsquo;s barely justifiable: an attempt to get Kim the banking-law gig she deserves ruins her former law firm and pushes Chuck to burn himself alive. It also silently drives a wedge in their relationship which grows like an ingrown nail. But he did it for Kim. So everyone moves on. Then he intrudes her work, both figuratively and literally by barging into her office begging her to scam assistant district attorney Suzanne Ericsen (Julie R. Pearl) into releasing his bodyguard Huell (Lavell Crawford) with no jail time. After that, Kim starts taking the lead, setting Jimmy up to fake public displays of remorse for Chuck&rsquo;s passing so that he can get his law license reinstated.</p>

      <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FQwpu28XIAAuEAg?format=jpg&name=large">

      <p>The increasing precarity of each of their scams is a source of considerable dramatic tension, but in the end they always succeed. By the fifth season, Gould has audiences so deeply accustomed to the happily-ever-after pattern that no other ending even seems likely. Finally, we have a set of morally questionable characters who can get whatever they want, by any means necessary. Deep inside, we know the writers would never let this utopia continue forever, but there is a shred of hope.</p>

      <p>Which the sixth season completely shatters. It cannot be a coincidence that Gilligan rejoined the writers&rsquo; room for the series finale &mdash; that the undisputed Master of Making Everything Fucking Implode makes everything fucking implode. Kim, now fully in the lead with Jimmy now the one hesitating and asking questions, orchestrates one last scam: smearing Howard Hamlin&rsquo;s (Patrick Fabian) reputation to finally settle the Sandpiper settlement (which was ongoing since the first season). The buildup is routine, if more elaborate and slightly more tense than for their previous con jobs. Kim thinks she&rsquo;s being followed; Jimmy recites Proverbs 28:1 (&ldquo;The wicked flee when no man pursueth&rdquo;). But the fallout is like a slap to the face &mdash; or, a bullet to the head, since that&rsquo;s how Howard eventually dies, right in front of them. With his blood slowly oozing towards her and soaking their living room rug, Kim realizes just exactly what they&rsquo;ve been doing until now. &ldquo;His body at her feet is the embodiment of guilt, and the conscience that she has been saying keeps sneaking up on her when she talks about being followed,&rdquo; Seehorn told Variety magazine.</p>

      <p>Violence and the law have been strictly separate worlds until that moment. The cartel was the cartel&rsquo;s business, and with every transition away from it we could reasonably expect to see the violence fade away as well. But with that safety tape now torn off, and the two worlds have collided, nothing will ever be the same.</p>

      <p>Some falling action takes place, and thus concludes the events of the present day, with the assumption that the events of <i>Breaking Bad</i> follow suit. The final three episodes fast-forwards ten years, where the consequences of their actions are in full swing. Jimmy-McGill-turned-Saul-Goodman is now a wanted man in hiding under the pseudonym Gene Takavic, but even that doesn&rsquo;t last long: given the readily available opportunity to disappear under another identity, he refuses and devises another scam, which gets him found and arrested. Kim now lives a soulless suburban life in Florida, with a husband who says &ldquo;Yep&rdquo; during sex and a desk job at a water-sprinkler company. She submits a sworn affidavit to the Albuquerque district attorney&rsquo;s office and to Howard&rsquo;s widow Cheryl (Sandrine Holt), confessing her and Jimmy&rsquo;s scam from start to finish. Lack of physical evidence means the district attorney will likely not press charges; but it is implied Cheryl will file a civil suit, and Kim will be left with nothing.</p>

      <p>Gilligan gives audiences no more than three minutes to process everything. Two of those minutes are spent frozen in horror as we are forced to watch Kim cry inconsolably on the bus back home. Several questions come to mind at that moment, the most important of which being: What the hell just happened? And why did we let it happen? And why did we enjoy it?</p>

      <p>The message is clear: no matter the brains, no matter the wife, no matter how lucky &mdash; consequences are real, and they are inevitable.&nbsp;&#9632;</p>
