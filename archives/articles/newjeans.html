      <p>I genuinely have no idea how to listen to NewJeans. And maybe that&rsquo;s the point. I&rsquo;m no expert when it comes to fourth-generation K-pop groups, but I&rsquo;d like to think that I&rsquo;m at least familiar with the various sounds girl groups have to offer: either it&rsquo;s cute upbeat bubblegum pop, or kickass black-leather cat-eye vibes a la Blackpink, or maybe some healthy mix of both with lead singers and rappers in the same group. It&rsquo;s a familiar pattern, and I&rsquo;ve learned to become used to it &mdash; which could speak to a number of things, including how cold and manufactured the K-pop industry has become as of late, or that I might be becoming socially liberal and musically conservative, but that&rsquo;s baggage to unpack another time. NewJeans, however, refuses such categorization entirely. In terms of aesthetics, they aim for a nostalgia-filtered throwback to the 90s and the noughties with their graphic-tee outfits and pastel color palettes, but musically all I can think of is, well, nothing.</p>

      <p>The <small>HYBE</small> group&rsquo;s first E.P. dropped in August, basically out of nowhere, and to great critical acclaim. I found it a few months later, and basically trashed it within five seconds of listening to &ldquo;Attention.&rdquo; I guess something irked me about the way the spliced samples at the beginning scratched my ear. I didn&rsquo;t make it much farther with &ldquo;Hype Boy&rdquo; either: for some reason the production felt a little rough around the edges. I had no idea what sort of energy they were aiming for. They need to pick a lane, I thought.</p>

      <p>With &ldquo;Ditto,&rdquo; released Monday, the pieces are starting to come together. The sound NewJeans have to offer is a genre of its own, and it&rsquo;s something I may finally be ready to embrace.</p>

      <p>As with every other track, &ldquo;Ditto&rdquo; opens with a disembodied vocal riff, though not as processed as the <small>MIDI</small>-tracked samples that open &ldquo;Attention&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hype Boy.&rdquo; But what follows diverges from the pattern: whereas other tracks would have immediately presented a layered background, &ldquo;Ditto&rdquo; offers only a simple snare rhythm. Then, as Haerin enters, the bass. Then, as Danielle takes over, the background retreats again, with just the claps, then builds back up with the snare. And that&rsquo;s it for the backing track &mdash; except for a quiet kick which might as well be the bass. It&rsquo;s subtle and complex in its simplicity, and it gives the singers room to breathe.</p>

      <p>The lyrics are standard: a person falls in love and hopes their feelings are requited. There&rsquo;s a few light metaphors to keep things tasteful (&ldquo;<span style="font-family:IBM Plex Sans KR;">널 보는 내 마음은 / 어느새 여름 지나 가을</span>&rdquo;), but there&rsquo;s nothing too ambitious. Ambition is noteworthy &mdash; it&rsquo;s the driving force for change in the industry &mdash; but I believe there&rsquo;s such a thing as too much ambition. Whereas NewJeans&rsquo; first E.P. was a bit much in that area, though much to their benefit given its critical acclaim and the hundreds of millions of plays since its release, this newest track definitely hits the spot. And I can finally wrap my head around the NewJeans thesis without the other clutter.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ll spell out what I know. <small>HYBE</small> are riding a thin line with NewJeans: all of the common K-pop girl-group aesthetics I listed earlier require some degree of sexualization and objectification, and I don&rsquo;t need to explain why that&rsquo;s problematic for a group whose youngest member is fourteen (and even in general). The solution, it seems, is to create an entirely new aesthetic, cool and detached, unique and appealing but not aggressively so. It&rsquo;s neither bubbly nor badass, or even &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; (i.e., racist); and the way they pull it off in &ldquo;Ditto&rdquo; is fascinating. The energy and drive of the song are contained by its stability. It&rsquo;s a catchy song, but it doesn&rsquo;t command too much attention. (&ldquo;Attention,&rdquo; as you could probably guess, actively demands it.)</p>

      <p>When I say detached, I also mean surreal. With other groups, even their most synth-heavy tracks use human-performed instrumentals, or at the very least imitate them. For example, Blackpink&rsquo;s &ldquo;Shut Down&rdquo;: for all its boomy 808s and raucous trap beat, above it all is a violin riffing Liszt&rsquo;s &ldquo;La Campanella.&rdquo; <small>IVE</small>, in &ldquo;After Like,&rdquo; samples the violin melody from Gloria Gaynor&rsquo;s &ldquo;I Will Survive&rdquo; for its chorus. But NewJeans &mdash; no such thing. Every sound in &ldquo;Ditto,&rdquo; if not a vocal or harmony, is artificial, or explicitly made so in production, and the song is all the better for it. Listening to it elicits a feeling I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on; but whatever the case, what matters in the end is that it&rsquo;s intriguing.</p>

      <p>A couple days back, I told a friend about my reservations with &ldquo;Ditto&rdquo; when it first came out, and he simply responded: &ldquo;Give it a day.&rdquo; And maybe he&rsquo;s right. While I still hesitate to say I enjoy NewJeans&rsquo; music now that &ldquo;Ditto&rdquo; is out, I think I am beginning to understand.&nbsp;&#9632;</p>
