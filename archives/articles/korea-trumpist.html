                <p style="color:grey"><i>An edited version of this article originally appeared on the <a href="https://dailytrojan.com/2022/11/01/bursting-your-bubble-south-koreas-trumpist-phase/" style="color:grey">Daily Trojan</a>. Since then, Yoon continues to face an ever-growing list of controversies, including a crowd crush during Halloween festivities in Itaewon which killed at least one hundred and fifty people, and more recently, the South Korean military's failure to shoot down five North Korean drones which invaded Seoul airspace 26 December. Yoon refuses to acknowledge responsibility or coordinate a proper response for either of the incidents. Still, by year&rsquo;s end, a barely recovering economy perched Yoon&rsquo;s approval ratings just below forty percent.</i></p>
                <p><span class="padded-dropcap">T</span>hree cheers for Liz Truss, the <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/11/liz-truss-has-made-britain-a-riskier-bet-for-bond-investors">Iceberg Lady</a> who lost to a lettuce; for the fresh hell that is Iran&rsquo;s most immoral &ldquo;moral&rdquo; government; and for whatever the hell the U.S. is doing right now.</p>
                <p>Democracy is at an age where it is of the people, and by the people, but certainly not for the people: the &ldquo;choices&rdquo; we are given to lead our countries are either this lunatic or that lunatic, and despite literally no one liking them once they&rsquo;re elected, there is nothing we can do to get rid of them except wait for the next lunatic-vs.-lunatic election. Look no further than Trump &mdash; <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx">whose approval rating never passed fifty percent</a> &mdash; and all the times Democrats tried to impeach him for his various (alleged) activities. &ldquo;<small>IMPEACHED</small>,&rdquo; read the 14 January 2021 cover of the New York Times. &ldquo;<small>TRUMP, AFTER INCITING RAMPAGE IN CAPITOL, IS FIRST PRESIDENT TO FACE 2ND SENATE TRIAL.</small>&rdquo; And what was the result of that second Senate trial? Nothing.</p>
                <p>With much of the media now intent on mocking the disaster that is Britain&rsquo;s Conservative Party &mdash; for whom voting intention is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/985764/voting-intention-in-the-uk/">at a meager twenty-two percent</a> &mdash; I would like to divert your attention for a quick moment on the equal, if not worse, calamity that is South Korea.</p>
                <p>As a Korean-American, I&rsquo;ve noticed that trends in Korea are always a couple years behind the U.S., be it <a href="https://dotesports.com/general/news/best-players-esports-1">e-sports</a>, Myers-Briggs personality tests, or the alt-right pipeline. Trumpism was no different. Two presidents ago, in 2016, reports that then-president Park Geun-hye disappeared for seven hours during the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/08/world/asia/south-korea-sewol-ferry-grief.html">Sewol ferry disaster</a> &mdash; which killed three hundred people, including two hundred and fifty-two high school students on a field trip &mdash; led to <a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/revolution-by-candlelight-how-south-koreans-toppled-a-government">nationwide protests</a>, and ultimately Park&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37971085">impeachment</a>, removal from office, and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-55657297">imprisonment</a>. At this point, Trumpism had already made its way into the Korean alt-right: fringe pro-Park counter-protests featured American flags right alongside Korean flags &mdash; a feature which soon established itself as a hallmark of the Korean right, much as the stars and stripes do today with the American right. Korea&rsquo;s Democratic Party won the next couple elections in a landslide, securing a majority of seats in parliament and Moon Jae-in as president.</p>
                <p>Then came Yoon Seok-yeol, the conservative who won this year&rsquo;s presidential election on an anti-woke, economy-first platform. His strongest voter base, surprisingly, was among twenty- to thirty-year-old conservative men &mdash; a key <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/alt-right">demographic</a> of the Internet-savvy alt-right, to which Yoon directly appealed by making campaign promises targeted at gamers and releasing an A.I. version of himself.</p>
                <p>What made Yoon stand out was that he wasn&rsquo;t the typical politician: he was a former prosecutor who dared to stand against his own party, in the name of justice, and indicted Park for collusion charges. He was more than willing to break convention; he didn&rsquo;t care for it. Any American who was alive in 2016 may be familiar with this line of reasoning. Trump was different: he was funny (at the expense of people with disabilities), he didn&rsquo;t give a shit, and people liked that. And that, in the end, was his downfall. Yoon now faces a similar fate.</p>

                <p>The following is a non-exhaustive list of his failures:</p>
                <p>He emptied out the official presidential residence, and opened it to the public as a <a href="https://www.opencheongwadae.kr/">tourist destination</a>. This proved to be a complete, and unnecessary, logistical disaster. The influx of tourism to the capital meant traffic congestion, worsened by the president&rsquo;s insistence on blocking out entire roads every time he <a href="https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/politics/politics_general/1046770.html">went out to buy bread</a>; the Ministry of National Defense was forced to move out of its offices for the president&rsquo;s use, a move which even conservative experts have criticized as &ldquo;an act of imperialist power&rdquo;; and I almost forgot to mention &mdash; the whole operation might cost over five hundred billion won (three hundred million U.S. dollars).</p>
                <p>When typhoons ravaged the country over the summer, Yoon gave orders by phone from his personal residence in Seocho-dong. Pressed by members of the opposition on the issue, his administration responded: &ldquo;Anywhere the president is counts as a briefing room.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Yoon&rsquo;s performance in foreign diplomacy is miserable: He declined to meet U.S. speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi when she visited Korea on 4 August, saying he was on vacation. He met with President Joe Biden on 21 September at a conference for the Global Fund, and spoke with him for a grand total of 48 seconds &mdash; after which Yoon was caught on tape making derogatory remarks about Biden and U.S. Congresspersons. As world leaders met in Britain for Queen Elizabeth II&rsquo;s funeral, Yoon arrived late, attended the reception, refused to pay respects to Queen Elizabeth lying in state (as every other leader, and even <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2022/09/18/in-photos-biden-and-other-world-leaders-pay-respects-to-queen-elizabeth/?sh=39163fd93249">Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy&rsquo;s wife</a>, did), and left.</p>
                <p>With Korea&rsquo;s image devastated, its economy in ruins with a weak currency and struggling stock market, and Yoon&rsquo;s refusal to take responsibility for any of it, his <a href="https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/politics/politics_general/1064665.html">approval rating</a> stands at thirty percent as of last Tuesday through Thursday &mdash; an improvement from twenty-four percent last month. Representatives for the Democratic Party on 14 October reiterated that he either resign or face impeachment &mdash; calls which will most likely fall on deaf ears. For now, South Koreans join Brits, Americans and others in patiently waiting to elect the next lunatic into office.</p>
