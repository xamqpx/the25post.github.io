      <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">T</inline>his year in sports has been, in essence, a complete upset. First, there&rsquo;s the N.B.A.: The Lakers have gone to shit; The Other L.A. Team is somehow in the top 10; and last year's champions are volatile and irrelevant,. Then there's the F.I.F.A. World Cup, where the only expected result was host nation Qatar&rsquo;s 0-3 elimination at the group stage. Argentina&rsquo;s loss to Saudi Arabia, Germany&rsquo;s loss to Japan, and South Korea&rsquo;s blazing win against Portugal, and Japan&rsquo;s V.A.R.-ruled goal against Spain all had fans reeling and sports bettors on edge. And let&rsquo;s not even get started on the N.F.L.: Super Bowl champs Rams are a complete disappointment with headliners Stafford and Kupp injured, and the 49ers are also dubious with Garoppolo now out for the season; now it&rsquo;s the <i>Dallas Cowboys</i> that are making headlines this time around &mdash; basically out of nowhere.</p>
      <p>But speaking of Dallas, there seems to be at least one person holding it all together, despite everything: Luka Doncic.</p>
      <p>The point/shooting guard for Dallas has had nothing but a stunning career. When he entered the N.B.A. four seasons ago, a string of accolades from Real Madrid and EuroLeague already behind him, people immediately recognized he would be a force to be reckoned with. He ended that year averaging 21.2 points per game with 42.7 percent of field goals made, and eight triple-doubles to boot &mdash; really, the only downside in his rookie stats was a negative plus-minus, which never happened again in subsequent seasons.</p>
      <img src="../uploads/luka_fg.png">
      <p class="photo-credit" style="text-align:right;">Data as of 5 December 2022, courtesy of <b>N.B.A.</b></p>
      <p>What set him apart was how &hellip; un-athletic he seemed at face value. He wasn&rsquo;t a sprinter, he wasn&rsquo;t some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Professorlive">Professor</a>-level ball-trickster, and he certainly wasn&rsquo;t the short-but-nimble three-point-maniac like Stephen Curry, either. But there&rsquo;s a certain determination and deftness to his play, coupled with an impeccable grasp of fundamentals, that makes the ball go straight through his defenders. &ldquo;He plays the puppet master game with you,&rdquo; said former N.B.A. All-Star Gilbert Arenas of Doncic in a <a href="https://youtu.be/0rqbH4uwO8c">podcast</a>. Patience is a virtue in a sport dominated by athleticism, and Luka had it nailed from the start.</p>
      <p>Since that season (in which he won Rookie of the Year), it&rsquo;s only been up and up for the Slovenian. His sophomore year, he made a career-high seventeen triple-doubles, along with other improvements across the board that together landed him in the All-Star team. He shined in the 2021 playoffs, with a whopping 35.7 P.P.G., averaging ten assists, eight rebounds, and a three-point percentage on par with Curry&rsquo;s. Audiences reveled in the Mavs&rsquo; first Western Conference round with the Clippers, with Kawhi Leonard finally stepping up as a worthy match to Doncic, and both players unleashing what many saw as a glimpse of their fullest potential. &ldquo;This how Luka imagined the N.B.A. defense was gonna actually be like growing up,&rdquo; wrote one user in a YouTube comment, to 410 likes.</p>
      <p>Though Luka&rsquo;s Mavs ultimately lost that round four to three, the loss has only encouraged him. Now twenty-three, he&rsquo;s a major contender in the Kia M.V.P. Ladder (Boston&rsquo;s Jayson Tatum just clinched the top spot from him last week); he&rsquo;s leading the league with 33.4 P.P.G. this season, having gotten at least two forty-plus-point games a month since October, and five triple-doubles to boot.  Doncic is chugging out stats like a freight train, and so far he&rsquo;s showing no sign of stopping.</p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s too early to tell whether he will be crowned M.V.P.; Tatum, Denver&rsquo;s Nikola Jokic, Milwaukee&rsquo;s Giannis Antetokoumpo, Phoenix&rsquo;s Devin Booker, and &mdash; of course &mdash; Curry are all worthy contenders, and the competition is especially fierce this year. But unless something drastic happens, I would dare call it right now. Luka for M.V.P.&nbsp;&#9632;</p>
