        <i style="color:grey">Content warning: the following contains mentions of sexually explicit acts and suicide.</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <inline class="padded-dropcap">W</inline>e’ve been running for so long — through fire-blackened hills, winding dirt roads past rotting wooden fences in and out of golf courses — from the sun in our eyes to the sun in his eyes, the wind in our faces, the sound of people watching, the feeling that I am doing something terribly, terribly wrong — and we’re finally here. The community pool up the hill from my house.
        <br>
        <br>
        “It’s closed,” he says, panting, standing behind me.
        <br>
        <br>
        “It has been for a while,” I say.
        <br>
        <br>
        He steps forward, embraces me from behind. His hand is on my stomach. 
        <br>
        <br>
        “Really.” His hand is on my stomach. For some reason I find it a bit harder to stay standing.
        <br>
        <br>
        “Yeah.”
        <br>
        <br>
        I forget what I’m saying. My hand is on his now, the one on my stomach. His thumb is tracing a crevice, as if to etch it into himself — as if to remember the feeling of warm fabric, of imagined skin. <i>A million things,</i> something says to me. <i>I would do a million things for him. </i>
        <br>
        <br>
        So this is what this is, then. This is what I have to be ashamed of.
        <br>
        <br>
        We stare at the pool for a while, the pool that’s closed, him behind me, me behind him. I forget how I met him. I forget we’re in a pandemic. I forget that I left my house in the middle of a pandemic. I melt into him, slowly, forgetting, forgetting, forgetting —
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>Turn around,</i> the something from earlier says.
        <br>
        <br>
        I do. Slowly. I face him, look him in the eye — the something goading me on. He cocks his head, feigning curiosity. His hands are on my back now, his thumbs still tracing. I copy him. He likes it; he smiles a little. He knows what I want. He waits for me to ask it first. <i>Can I kiss you?</i> “Can I kiss you?” I ask.
        <br>
        <br>
        He pretends to think. “Hm. Yeah.”
        <br>
        <br>
        His lips purse against mine. I lose myself, slowly, then all at once. He grabs me and pulls me in closer. I sink into him. So this is what this is, then. I can’t see; I can’t hear anything but his own shaky breath. I lose my own breath; find it again. This is supposed to feel wrong. What? <i>This doesn’t feel wrong.</i> This doesn’t feel wrong. This is supposed to feel wrong. I stop first.
        <br>
        <br>
        “Oh, um.” We look at each other, share a quiet laugh. “You okay?” he asks.
        <br>
        <br>
        “Yeah,” I say. I check my phone: 5 missed calls. “Yeah, I’m good, I… I have to go.”
        <br>
        <br>
        And I run. I run from the pool, down the hill, through the golf courses, over the fences, down the hill, down the hill, the something following close behind, screaming, <i>Remember this, remember this, remember, remember—</i>

        <inline class="padded-dropcap">M</inline>y earliest memory of my dad was when he wasn’t my dad. I was in the line at Disneyland waiting for a ride, holding his hand. I looked up to ask him something, and he wasn’t my dad. He was some white guy, confused but sympathetic, wondering where this kid’s parents had gone but the line was too much of a frenzy for him to really figure it out. Somehow at that moment my mom found me and scooped me up. And that was the end of that. My earliest memory. Maybe it was a dream; I can’t really be sure. But I remember it.
        <br>
        <br>
        I remember he quit his job at some point. About a week later I followed him to the garage, where bottles and pumps of all sorts of colors lined all those chalky white foldable tables from Costco that used to just be shut up in the shelves. The pumps made some bubbling noise and a little whir, just to remind you it was a machine. I couldn’t tell you what exactly it was called, but I do know it had something to do with refilling printer cartridges, and it taught me about colors better than school ever could: the cyan and the magenta, the yellow and the black. The labels were hard to miss. CYAN, MAGENTA, YELLOW, BLACK. I’d sit there from time to time, with my dad busying away at the machine, and he’d shoved into my hands a laminated piece of paper with the times tables printed onto it, and told me to recite it. Two times two is four. Two times three is six. I felt my breath tighten. The machine kept whirring. Six times seven is forty-two. The sun was setting, dinner should be ready any time now. Eight times nine. Dinner was ready.
        <br>
        <br>
        I remember he taught me a lot. He showed me what scientific notation was when I was still in elementary school; that probably meant I already had some notion of exponents and intangibly high numbers at that point. And it was his fault. But he couldn’t help himself, he was an engineer through and through; I couldn’t help myself much either, I was a kid dying to learn anything and everything. He also probably had something to do with the Spanish and Mandarin workbooks that suddenly appeared on my desk one day, sometime in the second or third grade. They showed up, I did them, and they changed my life. Whole new worlds opened up on the page — worlds that I still remember to this day.
        <br>
        <br>
        I remember one phone call I had with my dad. He was driving home from work, and I had my mom’s painfully bright blue flip phone clamped in my grubby hands, kneeling backwards on the couch and staring blankly out the window. I was telling him something about the new houses they were building up the hill; I don’t know, it even felt like gibberish at the time, and looking back at it now, whatever it was, it was probably more than laughable. But my dad never laughed once. He agreed and engaged with my gibberish, even while he was driving — like I was an adult, a co-worker. So I kept talking; I didn’t really care that I wasn’t making sense, I just liked hearing my dad’s voice. And I think he felt the same way too. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I don’t remember his face.

        <inline class="padded-dropcap">F</inline>inding queer people to date in Los Angeles is a talent and I do not have it. I don’t go to parties where you sip sociably from red cups and drunkenly kiss someone you like. I can’t make myself attracted to the femininity gay people often present, and I wonder if it’s just a preference or internalized homophobia or if I’m just jealous. I’m sure it’s somewhere in between. I try not to think about it. For the most part, I pretend that everything’s fine, that I could find a man the way women find men. Everyone else seems to know you can’t, as a gay man — except the two dozen gay couples on TikTok who somehow aren’t embarrassed to film themselves being intimate.
        <br>
        <br>
        Week after week, I’m reinstalling and uninstalling the same three dating apps — blocking the hairy 36-year-olds who call me cute, catching up on old matches knowing I have no chance with them, flirting with DL vers tops on Grindr knowing I’m only filling a void. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The longest I lasted with someone was three weeks. I took him out to dinners and walked around with him on late nights and fucked him in the mornings. Then I lost feelings. It was instant. We’d gone long-distance, after the end of term. We rushed into it. That much was obvious. Maybe we thought we wouldn’t ever forget the feelings we had while we were together. I did. I think he didn’t. I started to forget pretty early on, but I refused to acknowledge it — until I sat down one night and really, really thought about it. And then the feelings were gone. Forgotten completely. We ended things then.

        <inline class="padded-dropcap">E</inline>verything is made of glass in Seoul: the windows, the doors, the bridges, the eyes. One look in the wrong direction and the floor might cave in. And no one will care when you fall through the floorboards. The average person is working forty to fifty-two hours a week, assuming their employer even cares about labor laws, possibly for the minimum 9160 won (7 USD) an hour. The woman who just walked past just took out credit-shattering loans to buy a Mercedes she can’t afford. That man across the street studied at a goshiwon for three years just to fail the civil service bar exam, again. That person’s brother killed himself last week. The housing market is skyrocketing. The job market is somehow both oversaturated and undersaturated. The government is a bickering shithole that hasn’t put out any sound policy decisions in the last two or three years. Who cares, who has the time to care if you fall? They will stare, though. What the fuck are you doing. Get up. No one has time for this.
        <br>
        <br>
        We’re at a <i>bunshik</i> diner under Seoul Station. It’s 9am, it’s chucking it down outside, and my mom said she wanted something spicy. I forgot what we ordered. The diner is run by a man who has lived through war and famine — and acts the part too. His wife runs the kitchen, wordlessly, her back bent. The man is a bit of a dick when he takes our order. I couldn’t be happier; I know that means the food will be good. It is. We feast.
        <br>
        <br>
        It’s 9:30am and the truckers eating at the other end of the diner are already shitfaced drunk. One of them walks up in the corner and gets in the man’s face. “Hey. You didn’t get me the noodles I ordered.”
        <br>
        <br>
        The man checks. “You never even ordered that.”
        <br>
        <br>
        “Well, I ordered it.”
        <br>
        <br>
        “If you did, I’d have it here.”
        <br>
        <br>
        “I want my money back, then!”
        <br>
        <br>
        “What the fuck are you talking about? You haven’t even paid yet.”
        <br>
        <br>
        My mom and I exchange an amused glance.
        <br>
        <br>
        “Get the fuck out of this diner or I’ll call the fucking cops.”
        <br>
        <br>
        “Fucking dog.”
        <br>
        <br>
        “Dumb fucking bitch.”
        <br>
        <br>
        The four of them shuffle out of the diner. I finally look up from the food I’d long finished. The man is poring over some papers, unfazed. There’s a picture framed on the wall, of the man and his wife. It’s their wedding, and they’re smiling that characteristic smile of every picture from the seventies: happy with a tinge of aching nostalgia. The picture is so worn that the black and white is just yellow and yellow now. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I’d like to think they were really that happy then. I’d like to hope they are that happy now. That they remember how happy they were in the picture on the wall.
        <br>

        Over the incessant whirring of the fan in the corner, the announcer on the TV drones on: Union workers are continuing to go on strike this week as they demand higher wages and better protections…
