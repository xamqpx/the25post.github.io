        <p>19 April 2022</p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="main">
      <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">T</inline>he first thing I noticed next to her dead body was the pile of old laundry.<br><br>
        Half of it was already folded. Neatly, the way she&rsquo;d always done it. The wrinkles on the shirts, mostly mine, somehow all gone. The T-shirts stacked separately from the long-sleeve shirts, the pants separate from the shorts. The towels tucked into exact thirds, as if measured by a ruler. She knew we would be folding them in half when we were using them, but she had a thing for folding them into thirds anyway.<br><br>
        It&rsquo;s cold: the thermostat reads 68F, and the hardwood flooring doesn&rsquo;t help. I had a feeling she would be dead. She didn&rsquo;t pick up when I called her. She didn&rsquo;t respond when I texted her good morning, good afternoon, or good night. One time, when I called, the phone went straight to voicemail; after the tone I found myself telling her I loved her.<br><br>
        It&rsquo;s been days since I&rsquo;ve heard her voice. I&rsquo;ve been afraid of confronting the truth. Thirty years from now, I&rsquo;d wonder why I didn&rsquo;t show up sooner, whether there was anything I could&rsquo;ve done to stop it. But there never was. I finally make my way home, and open the door.<br><br>
        What people fail to realize is just how unspectacular dead bodies look &mdash; humans crumpled onto the floor. Like an old ragdoll you grow out of. Her eyes were already closed; she seemed ready. Still, I kneel and wrap my hand around hers, then her wrist to feel for a pulse, just in case. No response; cold to the touch. I call the ambulance, just in case.<br><br>
        I sit next to her and start folding the rest of the laundry. I can&rsquo;t really see. My chest hurts. One after another.</p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <p>
          <inline class="padded-dropcap">I</inline>t&rsquo;s 2004. The sunlight pouring through the blinds makes warmer the already warm orange walls. Her husband had hated white walls. The uniform drab of American suburbia. When they bought the house three years earlier, he decided it would be better to make each room its separate universe. The living room which spilled upward into the second floor had the only white walls in the house. The powder room was a dark purple; the master bedroom bright red, the other bedrooms green.<br><br>
        I&rsquo;m in our other, smaller living room. The orange one. I&rsquo;m in a walker, laughing at the sensory overload that surrounds me as I violently smash the multi-colored buttons. As violently as a toddler can. She&rsquo;s sat next to me, half tired, half immeasurably happy.<br><br>
        &ldquo;Are you happy?&rdquo; she asks.<br><br>
        I look at her. Her question blends into the machined childish chimes and voices coming from the walker&rsquo;s speaker. I can&rsquo;t speak. &ldquo;Um-ma?&rdquo;<br><br>
        &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;<br><br>
        Outside in our backyard, there&rsquo;s a thin maple tree whose leaves constantly litter the stone-studded ground. Right now, it&rsquo;s green. For the second time in my life, I&rsquo;ll watch it turn orange, then red, then brown as it falls to the ground again. The passage of time, so slow when I was a year old; it excites me. Thrilling. A rollercoaster.<br><br>
        I laugh.<br><br>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s making you happy?&rdquo;<br><br>
        I laugh again. I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
        
        <p></p>
        <br><br><br><br>

        <p>
          <inline class="padded-dropcap">T</inline>he government has me quarantined for my eighteenth Christmas. She&rsquo;s not in the house, only for a little; she can leave, so she&rsquo;s getting us something to eat. Ever since he left, she stopped seeing the joy in cooking herself. She started saying she was sorry whenever we sat down for dinner. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that much. I hope it&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; I&rsquo;d tell her it was fine, but I don&rsquo;t think she was ever talking to me.<br><br>
        I make my way to the small wooden bookshelf we have next to our piano, the one he bought for me. Strewn about on the bottom shelf are her old journals. I pick one and open it to a random page.<br><br>
        1985.XX.XX<br><br>
        J&mdash;-, I really miss you. &#8230; I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing or where I&rsquo;m going. &#8230; I hope you&rsquo;re okay. Let&rsquo;s meet again sometime.<br><br>
        I&rsquo;m not supposed to be seeing this.<br><br>
        1986.XX.XX<br><br>
        I still remember him like it was yesterday. He said he wouldn&rsquo;t leave us. He&rsquo;d protect us. The day I got the call &#8230; it couldn&rsquo;t be. I didn&rsquo;t want to believe he was gone. &#8230; car accident. I didn&rsquo;t get to see the body. &#8230; I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m alone now. Just me and my siblings. But I need to keep going.<br><br>
        She&rsquo;d be back anytime now, but it feels like forever. So I sit there, holding it, feeling the yellowed plastic cover as if it were my own.<br>

        Hi Jonathan,<br><br>
        Your writing in Korean is so good. You know I am proud of you. Keep it up.<br><br>
        I guess you are now in a trip to Kyungju, an ancient city with many histories. You should have learned Korean history and its beauty. Over all, I want you remember this trip as a good trip for a long time in your life and visit the place again many years later with your own child(ren).<br><br>
        I went there as a field trip when I was 6th grade. I don&rsquo;t remember the trip much now but it was an over-night trip. I was extremely excited for the trip but also scared very much as it was the very first time I left my parents since I was born.<br><br>
        I truly missed you and your mom, but I am okay for now although I am still playing with a tiny ghost (named &lsquo;M&amp;M&rsquo;) at night.<br><br>
        Stay healthy until come back home and enjoy the rest of time.<br><br>
        Also good care of your mom.<br><br>
        Bye for now and I love you.<br><br>
        Daddy</p>
        
        <p></p>
        <br><br><br><br>

        <p>
          <inline class="padded-dropcap">I</inline> come home one night. I open the door,<br><br>
        You have to go say goodbye to him right now.<br><br>
        What do you mean?<br><br>
        She grabs me by the shoulders.<br><br>
        What do you mean?<br><br>
        He&rsquo;s<br><br>
        You have to go.<br><br>
        Go, he wants to see you.<br><br>
        No, I thought it was fine. I thought<br><br>
        Please just go upstairs. I&rsquo;m sorry. He&rsquo;s<br><br>
        All the trips to the hospital, all the medication,<br>
        You have to accept it. Look at me. You have to accept it.<br><br>
        Please just go.</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>
          <br><br><br><br>
        another half, gone, gone,</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>
          <inline class="padded-dropcap">I</inline>t&rsquo;s a quiet morning. Birdsong is muffled by glass doors, the trees stop their rustling despite the breeze, the squirrels gathering their acorns hold their breath.<br><br>
        There&rsquo;s a piece of paper on the dining room table, blackened from corner to corner with hard-pressed ballpoint.<br><br>
        Why&rsquo;d you leave?<br>
        Where are you?<br>
        Where are you?<br>
        Where are you?<br>
        Where are you?<br>
        Where are you?<br>
        Where are you?<br>
        Where are you?</p>
        
        <br><br><br><br>

        <p>
          <inline class="padded-dropcap">I</inline>&rsquo;m folding the laundry. <br><br>
        The shirts, the pants, the pieces she couldn&rsquo;t fold. The faded T-shirt she used to wear when we went on hikes, the college hoodie she used to wear with such pride,<br><br>
        I&rsquo;m folding the laundry.<br><br>
        Are you happy? This half-filled, lost life. What made you happy?<br><br>
        I keep folding. The sirens near, late as always. <br><br>
        I&rsquo;m sorry, Um-ma.<br><br>
        I keep folding.</p>
