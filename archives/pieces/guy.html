    <div class="main">
      <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">T</inline>he thing is, you don&rsquo;t know who the hell you&rsquo;ll meet when you go and do something new. His name was Guy, he took pictures with film cameras and played guitar in a band, and in the summer of 2019 he came up from Kochi to Tokyo to help supervise our summer abroad session there.</p>

<p>Then, I was a silly sophomore, fresh out of the worst academic year I have experienced up to that point. School had lost its meaning for me; it hammered into me a sense of dread and worthlessness that stayed at my side to haunt me. I had no idea what I would want to do in college, and that made it so incredibly hard to aim for specific schools that I simply said &ldquo;Stanford&rdquo; every time I was asked for my dream college. But inside I was not convinced. My flame had sputtered and burnt out and I was left standing with ashes of fake dreams at my feet.</p>

<p>It was raining when we descended on Japan.</p>

<p>I felt tricked by Tokyo Narita Airport. Despite its name, the airport is nowhere near the city of Tokyo, a fact which was an ill-timed surprise to me. As the plane swooped down, the passengers to the left and right gazed out of the windows with wonder. From my seat in the middle column, I could only imagine the expansive metropolitan city, with its cold concrete buildings fitting snugly like puzzle pieces, rolling out in front of the plane below. Imagine my surprise when I found out that there was still an hour&rsquo;s bus ride to get to Tokyo.</p>

<p>But it was at the airport where I first saw Guy. All of the supervisors introduced themselves, him included, and he talked a bit about playing guitar, and that, yes, his name is actually &ldquo;Guy.&rdquo; My supervisor was named Sarah, and at first I was more attentive to her since she was the one responsible for me.</p>

<p>The next day, our buses pulled into the National Olympic Youth Center. It had been constructed for the 1964 Olympics, but would be our home for the next three weeks. Its orange-yellow buildings towered against the surrounding green sanctuary of Yoyogi Park. We made our way over to the main building, where we were sorted into our Japanese class levels. While Sarah was my supervisor, Guy became the assistant grader for my course. He read over the weekly reflection journals, where I was given prompts to reflect on my experiences and goals for the course.</p>

<br><br><br><Br>

<p><inline class="padded-dropcap">T</inline>hroughout the next couple of weeks, I poured my thoughts into the reflection journals, expressing everything from my concerns towards Japan&rsquo;s harsh work culture to my pleasant feelings from my homestay weekend. As Guy checked my writing, he left cheerful comments on every segment. He would offer his own opinion or explain a concept, always encouraging me to ask more questions about what I experienced on the streets of Japan. As I went through classes, excursions, and the homestay weekend, he began to relate to his own experiences in Japan. And it was also based on study abroad, but definitely much longer and more in-depth than what I was able to accomplish in a month.</p>

<p>I was not aware of it at the time, but his path had inspired me. The studying abroad, the homestays, things that he had previously done, were things that I came to enjoy. And the experience of being somewhere and doing something with like-minded people felt much more compelling than pursuing a top college or ramping up a successful career. I suppose Guy was one of those people who showed me that happiness could simply be about being in a place you like and discovering it with others. Because that&rsquo;s what he was doing, and god damn, he was doing it quite well.</p>

<p>During it all, I realized that I did want to stay in Japan for an extended period of time in the future. I figured that the best way to do that, without being required to blindly leap through hoops and jobs, would be to enroll at a Japanese university. I was definitely a silly sophomore back then. But Guy appeared to be receptive to the idea. It was a goal that, as unrealistic as it was, promised to me more of the narrow cozy streets, bright markets, colorful vending machines, bustling bookstores, and everything else that was right in front of me.</p>

<p>But as they all inevitably do, the day I was dreading came: July 7th, the last day of the program. I joined my fellow members in riding the shuttle to Haneda Airport. This time, it was actually in Tokyo. Each of us passed through the check-in line, and my memory fails me, but somehow, Guy and I ended up standing together, alone.</p>

<p>The noises of hurried passengers and their suitcases, bound here and everywhere, filled in the silence between us. Finally, he said: &ldquo;I think you can do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to a Japanese college. I mean, if you keep studying at this pace. You can do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I suppose he believed in me more than I believed in myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There, in Haneda airport, we parted ways.</p>

<br><br><br><Br>

<inline class="padded-dropcap">T</inline>ruthfully, I don&rsquo;t remember much about my flight back to America. I sat half-slumped in my seat, not knowing what to feel. It was so long, but it was so short. I was tired, and fell in and out of consciousness. It was all over, but it was just beginning.</p>

<p>By the time I walked out of the terminal at LAX, my experiences of the last month felt like a blurred notion of a distant dream. At the end of the day I was back home, sleeping in the same bed that I had been for years past, and for a while it felt like nothing had happened at all.</p>

<p>But about four days later, I received notifications for a platform I never thought I had to check ever again. Guy had left some final comments on my last assignment. Once again, he encouraged me to continue studying Japanese. And he had also written:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come back here sometime!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And suddenly everything came flooding back.</p>

<br><br><br><Br>

<p><inline class="padded-dropcap">W</inline>hen you decide to take a look at the world around you, and go travel somewhere, it happens once and it&rsquo;s over. You grab a friend or few, book a place, show up and have fun, take some pictures maybe, and come back. Those become memories. And you scroll through your camera roll and you see one trip and go, &ldquo;Oh, that was fun,&rdquo; and you keep scrolling. But sometimes you see a certain place and you stop scrolling. Because something there seems to call for your attention. Because that place seems to be screaming for you to go back and finish something incomplete.</p>

<p>I was silly as a high school sophomore, but I still don&rsquo;t know anything now. When people ask me what my major is, I consider switching it. When people ask me about my career plans, I reply that I don&rsquo;t know. When people ask me what my hobbies are, I question what I do. Because I don&rsquo;t know what I need to do. I don&rsquo;t know what I want to do. And I don&rsquo;t know how long, maybe a few years, or maybe my entire life, I&rsquo;m going to be lurching from subject from subject, from one stupid thing to another, stumbling through the dark. No, I don&rsquo;t know what the hell I must do.</p>

<p>But for now, I know where I must go.<br>
