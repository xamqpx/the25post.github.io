        <p>
          <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">I</inline> was in preschool. At that time, I was living in a different city. I would get some free time with papers and markers and sit and scribble. I&rsquo;d grip my pens with a fist, zigzagging along the surface. Some people laughed at me then. I&rsquo;m not sure if it was my parents or the teachers or the kids. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not supposed to hold it like that,&rdquo; they said amusedly. I didn&rsquo;t really care. I continued scribbling.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure exactly why I remember this.</p>
<p>I was in the lobby of the after-school with my mom when the receptionist handed me back the drawing I had submitted for a contest. I don&rsquo;t remember what it looked like. All I remember was that when I flipped it over and saw the &ldquo;1st&rdquo; written in the corner, I got a little excited. Just a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! First place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mom laughed a little bit and said, &ldquo;No, no, it doesn&rsquo;t mean first place, it means first grade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was not disappointed. I didn&rsquo;t care much for contests. I don&rsquo;t know if I cared that much about drawing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure why I remember.</p>
<p>In the following years, there was an attempt to get into art classes. I would go to a little studio with a room of at least twenty others and they&rsquo;d tell me to find a picture I like and sit down in a corner and copy it. I switched classes. Same thing. I switched classes. Same thing, but on Sundays. Still life, annoying. I switched classes. Same thing. Then I stopped. The half-finished sketchbooks are still sitting in a bag at the bottom of the closet under the stairs.</p>
<p>It was the stupid little cartoon characters.</p>
<p>In middle school I would draw by copying an image of a character from an anime or game or whatever and put it in my binder and be stupidly excited to switch seats because it meant someone would sit in my seat and see the drawing in the binder I left and they might think it was nice. I hoped they&rsquo;d think it was nice.</p>
<p>I got into high school and I&rsquo;d keep drawing. I&rsquo;d post drawings on my Instagram and then remove them a couple months later, because why did I do that? I&rsquo;d try a drawing course in freshman year, but wimp out of enrolling in AP Studio Art the next year. I&rsquo;d draw pictures for the notebook on my robotics team. I&rsquo;d draw more than that, on a different piece of paper, and then my captain would take my pen and cross all over it on the paper and be so rough that it broke the pen tip. I&rsquo;d try Game Art Design, and get bored of 3D Modeling. I&rsquo;d try Animation and only give half effort because I don&rsquo;t know. I got into the university with one of the best cinematic arts schools in the world and then went and planned my future with the Economics department. Why didn&rsquo;t I try harder?</p>
<p>But why did I continue?</p>
<p>Why did I continue drawing the stupid cartoon characters? I could&rsquo;ve had a passion in math or computer science or engineering or whatever, you know, something that made money and was handy, but I just had to go and start drawing stupid cartoon characters, sometimes with stupidly large boobs, and that was it, I&rsquo;d just sit in my room and stare at stupid ass boobs sketches all day, that was what I&rsquo;d do when I wasn&rsquo;t in class.</p>
<p>I saw a character design class in that cinematic arts school. When I went to enroll it was full. But I wanted it. I downloaded an app that would track openings for me. It rang at 2 am. I almost dropped my phone. I got the course.</p>
<p>
It made my Mondays terrible, just that three-hour section at the end of everything else. Seven to ten. Most of the time it would end a little bit early, but on the one day I needed to go to Target, we took the whole time and it closed. But my professor was very bright and cheerful. I did my weekly assignments along with the rest of the students. And so for a lot of Mondays, we met on Zoom and she talked through our assignments and drew a little bit herself and that was the closing for my Monday. And then I&rsquo;d wake up on Tuesday morning, and it was a thing, I&rsquo;d try to wake up an hour before my online class every day, not to eat breakfast or dress smart or whatever, but to practice a little drawing on my silly tablet.</p>
<p>On the final Monday, we all decided to meet in the actual designated classroom. I made my way over to the building at the cinematic arts school. There we gathered around the table to look over our classmates&rsquo; final portfolios. Someone had brought donuts, and someone else had brought cookies. We had a bit of fun talking and eating and looking at our works. I sat there among the great Animation majors. Maybe I should have transferred to Animation. Oh, but I want to study abroad, and animation majors have a hard time doing so. Oh, and it&rsquo;s still difficult to get a stable career as an artist, so maybe I&rsquo;ll do something more stable and do art on the side. Oh, and, and, and&#8230;</p>
<p>The professor asked me what major I was, and I said &ldquo;Econ.&rdquo; And she responded that it was impressive that I would go and do this. That I had taken the effort to do this, and that she liked the characters and that it was good work. And I walked out of that room and out of that building onto the street back home and it was dark and a bit chilly outside but there were warm orange lamps and I had a donut in my hand and I remember wishing that the night would never end.</p>
<p>I think I now know why I remember these things.</p>

  <inline class="padded-dropcap">D</inline>ear Peter,</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re eleven now, going on to middle school. There are some strange years coming. You&rsquo;re not even going to develop self-awareness for another four.</p>
<p>I think you should find something you like. And I mean things that you really like, not something your parents tell you to do. But know that your parents are just trying to help. You won&rsquo;t understand this for a while.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to get into a nice college. Maybe not the one you&rsquo;re expecting, but it&rsquo;s still nice. It&rsquo;s better. You&rsquo;re going to find something you like. You&rsquo;re going to fall in love with things and places and people you&rsquo;ve never even thought about. You&rsquo;re going to make friends, even on the other side of the world, who will support the things you do.</p>
<p>Just do something a little bit nice. Just do something you like.</p>
<p>You can pick up a piece of paper and pick a cartoon character, and I don&rsquo;t care how silly you think they are. I don&rsquo;t care how silly you think it is. You can draw it and put it on your binder.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll come to your seat. I&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s nice.&nbsp;&#9632;<br>
