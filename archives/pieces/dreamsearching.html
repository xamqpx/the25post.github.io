      <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">I</inline> swear I was blinking when I was dreaming.</p>

      <p>I remember long hallways, a shower, men in the shower. They have bodies and no faces. I look at the bodies. I don&rsquo;t want to. Sometimes they want things. There&rsquo;s always a basement. It&rsquo;s never scary. I&rsquo;m alone, and used to it. I miss these places. I&rsquo;ve never been here before, but I have. And then we are playing some game. I don&rsquo;t know who &lsquo;we&rsquo; are. The game is that we are being chased, and I do not want to lose this game. Run, friend, run. Through the hallways. Isn&rsquo;t this game so fun? I am outside. It is a garden, surrounded by the school, the school that is there but not there. There are trees in the garden. There is a fountain in the middle of the garden. Good job, he tells me. I don&rsquo;t know who &lsquo;he&rsquo; is. Good job, he tells me.</p>
      
      <p>Let&rsquo;s go home.</p>

      <br><br><br><br>
      
      <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">I</inline> love you and you are my wife. I love you, wife. We have children together. Happy children. Look how happy they are, how happy they make us. Before we married, I showed you to my parents. My parents were happy to see you, happy that I would be marrying you, happy that I would have a wife. Dear wife, you are so happy and I cannot look you in the eyes. I love you, wife.</p>
      
      <p>I love you and you are my child who I had with your mother. I love you, child. You are a happy child. Look how happy you are, how happy you make me. After you were born, I showed you to your grandparents. Your grandparents were so happy to see you, happy that I had you, happy that I would be having a child. Dear child, you are so happy and every single day I am lying to you. I love you, child.</p>
      
      <br><br><br><br>
      
      <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">H</inline>e&rsquo;s following the ridges of my knuckles with his thumb. He has soft eyes. We are at a beach. We are looking at the beach, the waves, pristine, crashing against the shore.</p>
      
      <p>After a long silence, he says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so pretty.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>He&rsquo;s smiling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad I met you.&rdquo; Creases form around his eyes when he smiles. His thumb stops.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p>His eyes go white. He wants to kiss me. I shiver and look out again at the beach, at the crashing waves. It smells like crabs rotting in salt.</p>
      
      <p>He asks again, out loud this time. I don&rsquo;t answer. I feel like I could throw up. I remember the first time I came to the beach, four or five months young, through winding roads, how I wasn&rsquo;t afraid to get sand in my shoes, and the waves crashed out, not in. My father would hoist me up on his shoulders and point his sturdy fingers to the horizon. That&rsquo;s where my home is. Some imaginary land across the Pacific. We&rsquo;ll go there together someday. Suddenly I&rsquo;m convinced the man sitting next to me is an abomination.</p>
      
      <p>I stand. &ldquo;I think we should see other people.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t want to see people ever again.</p>
      
      <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; He starts talking. Shut up. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing. I look down to tell him as much. He&rsquo;s gone.</p>
      
      <p>The waves are inching closer. They start lapping at my feet. Come. I start walking. The water wraps around my legs, then my arms. There&rsquo;s a face in the water. The face has soft eyes. The face is smiling. Surely there&rsquo;s something better out there, out there where my home is.</p>
      
      <p>I keep walking. Good job, he tells me. Let&rsquo;s go home.</p>
