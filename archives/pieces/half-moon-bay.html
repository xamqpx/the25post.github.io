      <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">m</inline>y family was never really one to sing 'auld lang syne' come new year's eve. we would silently get in the car and drive about an hour west to half moon bay, to watch the sun set and slowly dim the view of murmuring couples and ships sloshing in a hushed tug of war between anchor and tide. and we huddled together, mother, father, and i - as the air got chilly, and family felt warmer than the heaps of layers we'd worn to prevent exactly this sort of thing. but it didn't really matter.</p>

<p>
my parents frequented this spot for dates - either here or bodega bay some miles off. then life came and went, and last year, it was just my mother and i, looking over that same sun setting over the couples and the ships and the unspoken deafening absence of the person who was the reason we even came here in the first place.</p>

<p>
at once it felt exactly the way we had left it the year before, and changed beyond recognition. there was the winding gravel path where groups of women sat on the benches and talked a little bit too loudly; and right beside the path was a cliff that dropped at least fifty feet, and with no railings or any preventative installation whatsoever seemed to dare to trip and fall into it; there were the ever abundant and ever persistent flowers, the barbecue smoke rising from the RV park overlooking the beach. all of that i had seen before. walking through this part, to the left of the lot where we always parked, takes about thirty minutes to an hour, depending on how much you care to see of it.</p>

<p>
then there's the other part, to the right of the lot. across the street there's an impromptu skate park, which is really just a big old wooden U protruding from a grass field, infested with feisty kids and their skateboards. the rest is a quite cute but busy square, housing restaurants in every corner. one of them was your average diner, besides the fact that for a diner they had a particular infatuation with making america great again. my mom and i were hungry, but not enough to willingly eat under a roof sporting an american flag that was one size too big for comfort. so we promptly skipped that. our next option was a peruvian restaurant that went two stories high and had some interesting dishes on the menu, with a really nice waitress that said we had to have made a reservation to dine in. bullshit.</p>

<p>
we kept walking and found ourselves in an indoor row of shops and restaurants, built like a greenhouse with its glass ceiling and abundance of plants. every single place was closed - probably covid related - except for this one mom-and-pop mexican/peruvian place. we ordered some kind of bowl - i cannot remember the name to save my life right now - and they forgot to give us forks but we didn't really care. meat and rice and vegetables blurred into my fork and in then into my teeth and i could've sworn i was floating.</p>

<p>
the only thing left to do after that was to watch the sunset. it was a lot of orange and purple. neither of us said a word. anything worth saying was about the man that wasn't there; and what we were not about to do was cry on the last day of the year. my mother let me drive home, which almost proved to be a mistake on several occasions; but i remember it fondly. there was something thrilling about the winding concrete junctions of route 92 melting into the bay bridge, and talking along the way about college and the things to come and laughing for once - at the smallest things, but - again - did it really matter?</p>

<p>
there's a tree that guards the yawning cliffside. it splits at the roots into two thick branches, each stretching out for a little then giving way to gravity and drooping at the end. it's always been there; it's been there so long there's a well-trodden path that winds through the split and darts for a bench resting beside another nearby path. every time i visit this place, and i pass this path through the roots - i press my hands on the old bark, and i am reminded of the constant in my life that is half moon bay. whose roots are older than memory but whose leaves still sway and fall and grow again anew...&nbsp;&#9632;</p>
