                    dress changes every time I think about her. Green. Orange?
                    She’s strutting, one foot placed in front of the other,
                    silent commanding clacks of heels on age-old brick, this
                    plaza in Lisbon her fucking runway. She has an inscrutable
                    expression: eyes hinting at a life long lived, skin worn
                    down by the sun and wind. The muscles around her eyelids are
                    relaxed. She looks ahead, and only straight ahead, as she
                    moves. Maybe the dress had flowers — blue flowers. Green?
                    Joined at her hip is her husband. I don’t remember what he
                    looks like. Red plaid button-up tucked under brown cargo
                    pants, belt. That could be entirely made up. He glances —
                    up, the slightest bit — at her from time to time, walks in a
                    restrained scurry to match her catwalk. Their mouths are
                    moving, whispering insignificant things to each other as
                    lovers do. Maybe just to hear the sound of the other’s
                    voice. As people pass this small shop window, where I, a
                    nobody in a hat, stand cowering, their conversations dare to
                    reveal themselves to me — phone calls with coworkers,
                    children screaming, street vendors chirping, ringing laughs
                    — before they crawl back into the general human noise. But
                    these lovers stay in their own world, inaudible to reality
                    and reality irrelevant to them — glass mountains she carries
                    around her and hers. The road out of the plaza veers sharply
                    downward. A little horizon, under which the woman’s head
                    slowly, slowly drowns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I remember wanting her story. If I were more brashly
                    arrogant, or perhaps if I were quick enough on my feet to
                    have devised an excuse, I could have approached her and
                    asked her my so many questions:
                    <em
                        >Who are you? How did you get here? How do I live as you
                        live?</em
                    >
                    But no such thing happened. She, the unknowable, and I, the
                    tourist, were strung to our separate ways, meeting only at
                    that trivial moment. Absent a story, I left with a
                    conviction: I must come back.
                </p>

                <br /><br />

                <p>
                    <inline class="padded-dropcap">I</inline>n my dreams, the
                    plaza stretches to infinity. From a poet’s bronze statue sat
                    atop towering limestone — the singularity — this path of
                    glimmering patterned stone bursts forth: Past A Brasileira,
                    past Livraria Bertrand, it curves not down but up, stabbing
                    the misted heavens with a great force. Flanked on both ends
                    by marble buildings nondescript, the woman is by herself.
                    Her dress is green. She looks back at me. A cigarette wisps
                    away between her fingers. Her eyebrows are tensed — the rest
                    of her face unchanged.
                </p>
                <p>“What are you waiting for?” she asks.</p>
                <p>
                    I can’t, I want to say. I have a whole life behind me, a
                    whole life ahead of me. Here.
                </p>
                <p>But my lips don't move.</p>
                <p>“Look behind you.”</p>
                <p>
                    Everything is burning. The poet's statue is melting. Bombs
                    rain from the sky. Screams and gunshots ring over the
                    crackling of fire. Everyone I have ever loved is under the
                    rubble.
                </p>
                <p>She takes a long drag of the cigarette.</p>
                <p>“What are you waiting for?” she asks again.</p>
                <p>
                    I want to refuse. I want to believe the rubble is my home.
                    But my lips don’t move. And she only stares at me, letting
                    out smoke in a narrow breath. Then she flicks the cigarette
                    onto the ground and stomps it. She holds out her hand. Her
                    eyebrows relax again. The sun is so bright.
                </p>
                <p>“What are you waiting for?”</p>
                <p>
                    And I wake up in a burning bed. And I am reaching for her
                    hand. And I am reaching for her hand. And I am reaching for
                    her hand. And I am reaching for her hand.
                </p>

                <br /><br />

                <p>
                    <inline class="padded-dropcap">T</inline>he next morning,
                    after I first saw her, there was no trace of the woman. But
                    I saw the woman’s face everywhere I went. The first time I
                    noticed, there was a crowd cheering on three men taking
                    turns breakdancing. I thought I recognized them. I stopped
                    in my tracks, transfixed suddenly. No, their faces were just
                    as they were; but whenever they stood up laughing after
                    their turn they briefly glimmered, and I could swear they
                    had the woman’s face then, and in those flashes I would
                    remember the dream, and my heart would reach for the sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I walked, then I ran, up and down the cobbled streets,
                    scanning faces. A mother selling trinkets. A violinist
                    playing, quite slowly and out of tune. A frazzled man with
                    husks for eyes, sitting on the curb, chainsmoking away. They
                    all had the woman’s face. Or maybe I just wanted them to
                    have the woman’s face. Maybe none of it was real. Maybe I
                    wanted it to be real. My feet kept moving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At some point I came back to the same place I started. It
                    was cold. European summer heat had been unrelenting, but
                    today it decided to let up. There was an open table at A
                    Brasileira. I took my seat and ordered an espresso. A tiny
                    cup came clanging, with sugar on the side — just how they
                    liked it here. I took a sip. Bittersweet, dark. I looked up
                    at the poet. I knew now what it meant to feel a longing for
                    nothing but to long, a loneliness in the midst of people, a
                    never feeling pleased when pleased. I gave the poet a scowl,
                    as if to tell him as much. He said nothing back. He had the
                    woman’s face, too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On my last day, I was rushing to the airport, having slept
                    through my alarm, now a hair away from missing my flight. I
                    barged through the entrance, a frenzy of backpack and
                    suitcase. Taking a quick breath at the escalator as it
                    pulled me up, I looked back at the departures floor slowly
                    growing smaller behind me. I noticed a woman that was about
                    to leave. She had a green dress. I think. There was a man
                    next to her. They were laughing about something. Then she
                    looked up at me. I looked back. And we stayed like that for
                    a few seconds. I was sure she had some kind of twinkle in
                    her eye, as if to say something that I had already heard
                    before. Then she disappeared again. The escalator was still
                    going.
