        <p><inline class="padded-dropcap">I</inline>t hurts to open his eyes. Bright white light pouring in from every direction; it was never this bright in the nursing home.</p>

<p>He lies there for a few minutes, lets his eyes adjust. Slowly the light fades, even still intolerably bright. It's the sun. This is definitely not the nursing home.</p>

<p>Rolling hills stretch for miles, flushed with overgrowth and daisies and sunflowers. Hummingbirds, butterflies, aged oak trees; the quiet rush of a river winding through the grass. The sky is a little too blue. Like this is a dream.</p>

<p><i>Where am I?</i></p>

<p>He has the energy to sit up, finally, then stand. He walks to the river, checks his reflection. The wrinkles are gone. His eyes aren't worn and drooping anymore. His hair is blonde, not gray. He checks his hands: perfectly smooth. His back: straight. And he remembers who he is again: his name was Will Akner. He had a wife, Alice. They had two children together. He remembers now.</p>

<p>Somehow, he's young again. This is definitely a dream. Either that, or&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;You're awake,&quot; a voice says from behind. Will jumps, turns around. It's a man, darker, with a buzz cut and wearing all black; slightly taller, slightly larger, beard perfectly trimmed. Too perfectly trimmed.</p>

<p>&quot;Hi, Will,&quot; the man says. &quot;I'm Lucas. I've been waiting for you.&quot;</p>

<p>Will freezes. His mind races through every possible thing he could say, and settles with: &quot;Hi, um, what.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know you have a lot of questions,&quot; Lucas says, chuckling. &quot;Don't worry; you can ask them. I will answer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Am I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Yes, you are dead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At the age of 83, in your sleep, from Alzheimer's complications.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When you came here, I made you your thirty-year-old self again. I won't lie, you looked proper fit in your thirties; I hope you don't mind. You can always ask me to change it, though.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, well, hold on, then where&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are in the afterlife. And I'll be your guardian while you settle into things,&quot; Lucas says, as if reciting lines from a script for the millionth time. &quot;Also, before you ask: no, this isn't heaven, no, this isn't hell, not purgatory, not Nirvana &mdash; although that does sound quite nice, actually, Nirvana. Anyway, this isn't any of those. It's more of a ... second chance, if you will.&quot;</p>

<p>Afterlife. A second chance. &quot;A second chance?&quot; What bullshit. &quot;Where's my wife? My kids?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, hold that thought,&quot; Lucas says. &quot;Before I answer, we have some procedures to go through first.&quot;</p>

<p>Will is getting desperate now. &quot;Where the hell is my family, Lucas?&quot; he spits.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll show you,&quot; Lucas says. He grabs Will's hand. &quot;But we need to do a few things first, alright?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot; &#8230; Alright.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cool. Ready?&quot; Lucas puts his other hand on Will's forehead, brushes his hair aside. He smiles, gently. &quot;Close your eyes. Take a deep breath.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Breathe.&quot;</p>

<p>And suddenly, his entire life rushes through his head again. His mother cooing at him, a small child at five years old, his sisters tending to him, hugging his father when he came back from work, the bright red fire truck that he played with every day until he just stopped caring for it one day, school, teachers, friends, crushes, romances, his first kiss with a girl in the locker room before form, university, the first time he met Alice, dates with Alice, the glint in her eyes, god he loved her so much, will you marry me, Alice?, yes, yes, I do, yes, I do. until death do us part.</p>

<p>Then the children. And then the forgetting: it's Tuesday, don't you remember, Will? It's your daughter's birthday, don't you remember, Will? This is your house, don't you remember, Will? I'm your wife, don't you remember? Will? What's my name? Don't you remember? Who am I? <i>Who are you? Who am I? Who am I?</i></p>

<p>He's back, blood roaring in his ears, tears running down his cheeks. How pathetic. &quot;Breathe,&quot; Lucas is saying. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; It was such a good life until the forgetting, the forgetting. How pathetic.</p>

<p>&quot;So,&quot; Lucas says once he recovers. &quot;Would you like this second chance, then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My family, Lucas.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right.&quot; Lucas hesitates. &quot;Your kids, thankfully, haven't gotten here yet. Your wife, though, she &#8230; &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; His heart skips a beat. &quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's been here for a while. She, uh, ended her own life a few months before you died.&quot;</p>

<p>He has to be lying.</p>

<p>&quot;And now,&quot; Lucas continues, &quot; &#8230; well, there she is. See for yourself.&quot; He points.</p>

<p>Over the distant horizon, where the sun bleeds orange and purple as it sets, over the tallgrass, there stands Alice. Will recognizes her immediately. And there's another person. They're silhouettes, the two of them, talking and dancing under the fading light. And then they're kissing.</p>

<p>Will runs. Runs faster than he ever has in his life. Lucas follows behind, calling for him. He keeps running.</p>

<p>She's just the way he remembers her. Her wavy blonde curls, the ones he'd combed his fingers through countless times, held down by the red checkered headband she always used to wear. Her hands, just as soft as they used to be, holding another man's. The man looks so perfect. Too perfect.</p>

<p>&quot;Alice,&quot; he pants. His chest hurts.</p>

<p>&quot;Will,&quot; she replies. &quot;You're here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alice, what the hell are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will, let me&mdash;&quot;</p>

	    <p>&quot;Don't you remember? Don't <i>you</i> remember? All our life, after everything, we promised each other. Our wedding, you said, I said, until death do us part&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And now we're dead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot; &#8230; what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fifteen years, Will. I loved you so much, but fifteen years I was stuck with someone who didn't even know who I was, much less loved me back, and I was just so tired. I was sick and tired of just&mdash; when I married you, I wanted to be your wife, your lover, your best friend, not your nurse, not your personal assistant who had to convince you every morning that I wasn't a stranger.&quot; She's crying. &quot;I was just so tired. I needed something new.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And this is what you come up with? Kill yourself and run to another man?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will, he's everything I needed, everything that I couldn't have from you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I remember everything, now, Alice, Lucas showed me everything, I could be everything I couldn't be for you, not him, I could&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't. Will,&quot; she shouts. Then, quieter: &quot;I'm sorry. I can't anymore. &#8230; I have to go.&quot;</p>

<p>It's night now; Alice turns, avoiding her gaze the whole time, and with the man fades into the shadows. Will looks on, her outline seared into his vision, that too slowly fading.</p>

<p>Finally, Will turns too. Lucas is there waiting, his eyebrows furrowed. He reaches for Will as he walks to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's go home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll kill her. I'll fucking kill her, and that son of a bitch, too, I'll&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'd like to see you try. Come on.&quot; Lucas chuckles softly.</p>

<p>&quot;And fuck you too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alright.&quot;</p>
<br><br><Br><Br><br><br><Br><Br>

<p><inline class="padded-dropcap">W</inline>ill wakes up in the comfiest bed imaginable, under thickly padded white blankets and a handwoven quilt for good measure. It's an old house, wooden planks nailed together, the sun pouring through the frosted glass windows. There&rsquo;s a blanket and pillow loosely strewn about on the couch &mdash; probably where Lucas was sleeping. Lucas. He sits up, tracing his memory back from yesterday: the river, Lucas, a second chance, Alice &#8230;</p>

<p>Fifteen years, he'd been gone. Left her to tend for him like a baby while he just &mdash; at any rate, he deserved this. He walks out of the bedroom.</p>

<p>&quot;Morning,&quot; Lucas says. He's in the kitchen, making breakfast. He has no shirt on. &quot;You alright?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um, yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fancy some breakfast? Coffee, too, if you'd like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>They sit and eat in silence for a while.</p>

<p>&quot;So,&quot; Will says. &quot;What now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hm?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You were talking about a second chance yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mm, right.&quot; Lucas wipes his mouth. &quot;As I was saying yesterday, humans always talk about wanting a second chance. Like, if they could go back in time, they would do this differently, or they wouldn't have done that. You know. I imagine you feel that way about some things yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>Alice.</p>

<p>Lucas stares at him, as if reading his mind. &quot;And no, I don't think you'll be getting Alice back anytime soon,&quot; he says.</p>

<p>&quot; &#8230; and if I don't want this second chance?&quot; Will says. &quot;Then what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then, well.&quot; Lucas looks out the window. &quot;You can always opt-out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And how's that?&quot;</p>

<p>He sighs. &quot;Look, in most places here you can't die. You live forever, as long as you want. Except there's this one cliff, a few miles west from here &mdash; you jump down, and there's no going back. It's permanent.&quot; He stops, then says, almost mumbles, &quot;I &#8230; wouldn't consider it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can you show me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I just want to see it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay.&quot;</p>

<br><br><Br><Br><br><br><Br><Br>

<p>
  <inline class="padded-dropcap">T</inline>he wind howls and whistles. As they approach the cliff's edge, the ground is rocks, then more rocks, then more rocks, larger and steeper with each step.</p>

<p>Lucas offers his hand. &quot;Here. Grab me and climb up.&quot; His arms are strong. Fitting for a guardian of the afterlife. Will obliges.</p>

<p>&quot;We're not going any further,&quot; Lucas says. He's almost angry. Scared, maybe; Will can't tell. &quot;Unless &#8230; unless you want to. You have to, uh, really want to do it if you're going to make it to the edge.&quot;</p>

<p>Why does he care so much?</p>

<p>&quot;Well, alright. Let&rsquo;s go back, then,&quot; Will says.</p>

<p>&quot;Really?&quot;</p>

<p>He remembers Alice. &quot;This is what she did. The first time she was alive. At least she got another turn. If I jump right now, then I don&rsquo;t.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. Yeah, you&rsquo;re right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, were you scared?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; Lucas seemed red, but maybe it was just the cold. &quot;Well, yes, I&rsquo;ve just seen so many people jump, and, you know. I didn&rsquo;t want &mdash; never mind. Let&rsquo;s head back.&quot;</p>

<br><br><Br><Br><br><br><Br><Br>

<p>
  <inline class="padded-dropcap">W</inline>ill is out alone. Lucas told him about a huge garden downhill, told him there's lots of people there, that he should go out and meet some new people, that it's free admission because it's the afterlife for fuck's sake. So he's going.</p>

<p>Past the vine-infested archway, couples quietly walk the marble paths, marveling at the rose bushes, laughing as they dip their hands into the fountain at the center, snuggling each other just a little closer as they make their way through the bonsai trees and the ponds and the tiny waterfalls. <i>Remember when we were alive?</i> they'd say. <i>We couldn't do this back then. &#8230; I love you so much. I love you too.</i></p>

<p>He seems to be the only one who came to this place by himself; if there is someone else, he can't be bothered to look for them, much less start a conversation or, god forbid, make a friend out of them. He remembers Alice. If Alice was here, he</p>

<p>A useless thought. He looks at the garden, the people at the garden, for a little longer, his chest tight, his breath a little short. Over to the west, the cliff seems to loom the slightest bit larger. He leaves.</p>

<br><br><Br><Br><br><br><Br><Br>

<p>
<inline class="padded-dropcap">&quot;H</inline>ow'd it go?&quot; Lucas asks when he walks in. He's sitting at the table, still with no shirt on, smiley and soothing as always. &quot;Not so well, I'm assuming.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I went to the garden, like you told me to, and &mdash;&quot; He sighs. &quot;Everywhere I go, it just reminds me of Alice. It just seems like everyone there already has their partner, and I'm the only one there whose wife fucking left him because of a brain disease, and it's my fault, honestly, it's all my fault&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will.&quot; At some point Lucas had walked up to him. &quot;Nothing is your fault. She left, and that&rsquo;s that. You&rsquo;ve lived your life the best you could, and it just didn&rsquo;t work out in the end &mdash; even after a lifetime. And so you move on. Even here, there&rsquo;s no such thing as forever.&quot;</p>

<p>And he pulls him into a hug. It's the first one he's had in years. Decades, even; who knew how long he'd been here? Lucas is warm, his arms firmly shutting him in. Will doesn't mind. He could stay here forever. He could &mdash; was he crying? He was. Sobbing. Couldn't breathe. Fuck.</p>

<p>He pulls away. &quot;Sorry.&quot; He tries laughing.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't apologize.&quot; Lucas wipes his cheek &mdash; and then his hand stays there. Their eyes meet, and something makes Will hold the hand on his cheek.</p>

<p>They stand there like that for a little while, his hand in his. Then Lucas pulls his hand away suddenly. &quot;Sorry. I, uh.&quot; He's the one trying to laugh now.</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's okay.&quot; Will feels something &#8230; new, unrecognizable. &quot;Thanks. For being here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. It's only my job.&quot;</p>

<p>They smile. &quot;Okay.&quot;</p>

<br><br><Br><Br><br><br><Br><Br>

<p>
  <inline class="padded-dropcap">T</inline>hey're in the kitchen after dinner, making drinks. &quot;You're a beer person?&quot; Lucas shouts. &quot;God, no wonder you're so fucking insufferable.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At least I'm not some pussy who drinks seltzers and Cape Cods and calls it a night out.&quot; Lucas shakes his head. They clink their glasses together. &quot;Cheers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cheers.&quot; Lucas chugs it, slams the drink down on the counter. &quot;Hold on. I've got an idea.&quot; He starts opening drawers, ruffling papers. Will feels a rush of blood as he watches Lucas bend down. He tries not to think about it.</p>

<p>A minute later, he pulls out a laminated sheet. It's a menu. &quot;Now don't ask me how I got this, but&ndash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How'd you get it, then?&quot; There's a glint in Will's eye that Lucas hasn't seen before.</p>

<p>&quot;God, I'd kill your dumb ass if I could.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'd like to see you try.&quot;</p>

<p>Lucas tries a menacing glare and fails miserably. &quot;Well, anyway, I got it from an old friend. Came here just the way you did. He was a bartender, and he had this menu on him, and it's the funniest thing. Look.&quot; He points. They inch closer, poring over the drinks. &quot;I mean, Sex on the Beach is pretty tame &#8230; &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This one's literally just called Asses' Milk.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, we're definitely making that one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, it's just lemonade and rum.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's no way you're&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will. You did not spend all this time in the afterlife just so you can stick to your boring-ass beer. You ought to try some new things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;New things, huh.&quot;</p>

<p>He steps closer, pushing him against the fridge. &quot;How's this for a new thing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh.&quot; Lucas flushes red. &quot;I know what you're trying to do, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What am I trying to do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You just don't want to drink the Asses&rsquo; Milk.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, fine, I'll drink it,&quot; Will says, laughing. &quot;But first.&quot; He leans in. They kiss. Lucas tastes like cranberries. Peppermint. The beach.</p>

<p>They let go, panting. &quot;You alright?&quot; Will asks.</p>

<p>Lucas nods. &quot;This is a new thing for you? Doing this with a guy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lame.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, then I&lsquo;m making the drink now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not after that, you&lsquo;re not,&quot; Lucas says. &quot;Gotta finish what you started.&quot; He hoists Will up by the legs, carries him to the bedroom. They don't bother closing the door.</p>

<br><br><Br><Br><br><br><Br><Br>

<p>
  <inline class="padded-dropcap">L</inline>ight floods the room again in the morning, and Lucas is the first to wake. His bed feels full, he thinks, and then he remembers. He turns to his side; Will&rsquo;s still asleep, back turned to him. Lucas so desperately wants to wake him, but the sight of him sleeping in his bed is not worth disturbing. So he lies there with him, quietly, absorbing the view &mdash; of the rolling hills, of the sun, of the sky, of the man in his bed.</p>

<p>Soon enough, he grows restless, and he shuffles closer. One kiss on the back to let him know he&rsquo;s there, one under the chin to wake him, one on the lips just because. It works: Will is up, groggy but grinning ear to ear.</p>

<p>&quot;Morning,&quot; Lucas says.</p>

<p>&quot;God, it&rsquo;s so early.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is when I usually get up. And I&rsquo;m tired of waiting for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hate you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really.&quot;</p>

<p>Will turns and pulls him in. They kiss, again, for the millionth time since yesterday, but Lucas swears he would never get tired of it. &quot;Yes, really.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that&rsquo;s unfortunate, because I had something I wanted to tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>That makes Will sit up. &quot;Go on,&quot; he says.</p>

<p>&quot;I really like you,&quot; Lucas blurts. &quot;Ever since I knew you were coming here, something about you made me want to care for you, and well, maybe that&rsquo;s just part of my job, but I wanted to keep you around, to hold your hand, to give you the affection you deserved. And I didn&rsquo;t know if you wanted that, since I know you have your own things going on with Alice, but I really, more than anything, I really don&rsquo;t want to lose you.&quot; He&rsquo;s bright red again. &quot;I just wanted you to know.&quot;</p>

<p>Will can&rsquo;t help but laugh. &quot;You&rsquo;re only telling me this after we had sex.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can get nervous, too, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But not nervous enough to get me to sleep with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shut up.&quot;</p>

<p>They laugh. &quot;Well, I, um, I think I like you too. I just need some &#8230; time to figure things out. But I do like you, I think. And I care about you. A lot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, then.&quot; They kiss, one last time for the morning. &quot;We have all the time in the world, literally. Take however long you need.&quot;</p>

<br><br><Br><Br><br><br><Br><Br>

<p>
  <inline class="padded-dropcap">W</inline>ill is out alone again, back at the garden with the bonsai trees and the marble and the couples. Today, however, the garden&rsquo;s completely empty. He wouldn&rsquo;t have minded either way, but it&rsquo;s nice to have this place all to himself.</p>

<p>One part of him is worried. He&rsquo;s been worried &mdash; that maybe he&rsquo;s just been using Lucas to fill the void that Alice left. But there&rsquo;s also another part of him, especially after yesterday and this morning, that&rsquo;s starting to think that maybe it&rsquo;ll be alright to try new things. With Lucas. That the past is just the past, and remembering it and dwelling in it are two different things.</p>

<p>Out to the west, the cliff is nowhere to be seen. He runs back.</p>

<br><br><Br><Br><br><br><Br><Br>

<p>
  <inline class="padded-dropcap">A</inline> thousand years pass. Forever doesn&rsquo;t feel too long when he&rsquo;s with Lucas. He knows everything about everything, and the afterlife is boundless. Caves and oceans and wormholes and sprawling night skies, dates and sex and movies and dinners, they go everywhere, do everything, and it&rsquo;s as if time stands still when they lock eyes and rushes to oblivion at every other moment.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re walking through one of the villages, some thousands of kilometers away from their place, through the town square, the sun blazing from overhead. There&rsquo;s a woman sitting under the shadow of a lush oak, at the other end, and he knows her immediately. He could recognize her anywhere. Lucas squeezes his hand, then lets it go.</p>

<p>&quot;Alice!&quot;</p>

<p>She turns; her face brightens. &quot;Will!&quot;</p>

<p>He walks to her. &quot;It&rsquo;s been so long.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. It has.&quot; She glances behind him. &quot;I see you&rsquo;ve moved on as well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And with Lucas, of all people. Congrats.&quot; She pokes him. &quot;Is he nice, then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is,&quot; he says. &quot;He&rsquo;s wonderful.&quot; A thousand words left unsaid.</p>

<p>&quot;And the kids? You&rsquo;ve seen them around?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. Lucas showed me everything. I went round their places a couple times.&quot;</p>

<p>She nods. She seems lost in thought for a while, then says, &quot;You know, I should&rsquo;ve said this to you earlier, much earlier, but I hope you don&rsquo;t think I ever &#8230; regretted being with you while we were alive. Back on Earth, I mean. Because I didn&rsquo;t. And I know what happened wasn&rsquo;t your fault. I was just &mdash; being selfish, really &mdash; &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Trust me, Alice, I don&rsquo;t care.&quot; He means it. &quot;It&rsquo;s been so long since then. All that matters is that you&rsquo;re happy now. Are you happy now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am.&quot; She smiles. &quot;And you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alright.&quot;</p>

<p>A silence falls between them. There&rsquo;s too many things he wants to say; he settles with, &quot;I remember, Alice. Everything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alright. I&rsquo;ll, uh, see you around.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See you.&quot;</p>

<p>And he turns, walks away. Takes Lucas&rsquo;s hand. And he doesn&rsquo;t look back as they leave.</p>
