        <p><b>Santa Catalina Island</b>, the native-land-turned-tourist-destination renowned for its scenic charm, is now a collection point of the largest accumulation of ocean plastic in the world. Located between Hawaii and California, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch covers an estimated surface area of 618,000 square miles &mdash; an area three times the size of France &mdash; and contains approximately 80,000 tons of plastic.</p>
        <p>Amid ongoing multi-million-dollar cleanup efforts, researchers at the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies, located on the island, wondered if they could turn the trash into something useful.</p>
        <p>&hellip; Their paper, published in <i>Angewandte Chemie</i> in November, announced the successful application of the two-stage method to polyethylene &mdash; one of the most common categories of plastics, used in products like plastic bags or food packaging &mdash; from which they were able to derive pharmacologically active compounds, manufacturing materials and other products in bulk quantities.</p>

        <p><b>On April 9, 2022,</b> the USC baseball team dropped a game to Oregon State at Dedeaux Field, losing 3-2. It was the team&rsquo;s 11th Pac-12 game of the season, and the loss had the Trojans sitting at a 4-7 conference record. They would go 4-15 the rest of the way to finish 8-22 in conference play and end up dead-last in the Pac-12 standings.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to this past weekend, and the Trojans already surpassed that eight win mark, taking two of three games against Utah on the road to bring their conference record to 9-3, with 18 Pac-12 games left on the schedule for Head Coach Andy Stankiewicz&rsquo;s first season at the helm.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;I am certainly proud of them, we all are. Staff has put in a lot of good work in the fall. They&rsquo;ve been coachable and they&rsquo;re working hard so lots to be proud of,&rdquo; Stankiewicz said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. &ldquo;But at the same time, we&rsquo;ve got a long way to go and so we just have to stay the course.&rdquo;</p>

        <p><b>Our current relationship</b> with the environment possesses an inherent dichotomy. It could be argued that a core American value is the appreciation of Earth&rsquo;s natural beauty as the United States is often listed as one of the world&rsquo;s most naturally beautiful nations.</p>
        <p>Patriotic anthems boast spacious skies above fruited plains from sea to shining sea, and the U.S. became the first country to establish national parks to preserve wondrous landscapes in 1872. However, alongside an ostensible pride in this imagery seems to lie a concerning acceptance of its destruction. According to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute, the U.S. is responsible for nearly a third of both the world&rsquo;s energy consumption and carbon emissions &mdash; a disheartening disproportionality considering that U.S. citizens make up only 5% of the world&rsquo;s population.</p>
        <p>Earth Month might be an example of this duplicity. Only observed by 20 million people upon its creation, Earth Day began in 1970 by former Wisconsin Senator Gaylor Nelson. Being influenced by youth protests and the publication of Rachel Carson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Silent Spring,&rdquo; Earth Day expanded over the subsequent decades through technological mobilization and expanding legislation &mdash; many of which were spearheaded by Nelson himself.</p>

        <p><b>Russia is threatening</b> to increase military presence along the 1,300-kilometer border it shares with the Nordic country. Finland had initially planned to join alongside neighbor Sweden, but the latter had its ratification stalled by objections from Turkey and Hungary.</p>
        <p><q>For Finland, the most important objective at the meeting will be to emphasise NATO&rsquo;s support to Ukraine as Russia continues its illegal aggression,</q> said Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto in a statement Monday. <q>We seek to promote stability and security throughout the Euro-Atlantic region.</q></p>
        <p>In an earlier statement, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he looked forward to <q>a rapid conclusion of the accession process, and to welcoming both Finland and Sweden to the NATO family as full members as soon as possible.</q></p>

        <p><b>For the first time</b> in 50 years, NASA has named a crew of astronauts bound for the moon.</p>
        <p>The four people announced to go aboard Artemis 2, which the agency plans to launch in 2024, are: commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, and mission specialists Christina Koch and Jeremy Hansen. Hansen is an astronaut from the Canadian Space Agency.</p>
        <p><q>Reid, Victor, Christina, and Jeremy, each of these adventurers has their own story. But together, they represent our creed: E pluribus unum — out of many, one,</q> said NASA administrator Bill Nelson.<q>Together, we will usher in a new era of exploration for a new generation of star sailors and dreamers — the Artemis Generation.</q></p>

        <p><b>Monday&rsquo;s sweeping win</b> against San Diego State marked the end of an impressive streak for the Huskies, who have now won all six of their tournament games by a double-digit difference.</p>
        <p>The Aztecs lost a crucial early-game lead, missing 14 straight shots in the span of 11 minutes, and allowing UConn to come back leading by four by halftime. Seniors Adama Sanogo and Tristen Newton led the charge, both with double-doubles &mdash; Sanogo 17 points, 10 rebounds; Newton 19 points, 10 rebounds.</p>
