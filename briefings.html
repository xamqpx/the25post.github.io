        <p><b>A suspected lone gunman</b> fired into a bank in downtown Louisville Monday morning, killing at least five and injuring six others, police said. The shooter has been neutralized on the scene.</p>
        <p>Police said they received calls at 8:30 a.m. for an <q>active aggressor</q> at the Old National Bank, of which the suspect appeared to be a former employee. Rounds were still being fired when police approached the scene; police exchanged gunfire with the shooter but his exact cause of death remains unknown.</p>
        <p>FBI special agents are also on the scene assisting law enforcement. Exact motives remain unknown. The shooting comes just two weks after another deadly shooting in Nashville.</p>

        <h2>Biden on 2024: <q>I plan on running</q></h2>

        <p><b>President Joe Biden</b> confirmed he plans on running for re-election in 2024.</p>
        <p>At a White House Easter egg roll Monday morning, Biden said to NBC <q>TODAY</q> co-host Al Roker that he would run, but <q>we&rsquo;re not prepared to announce it yet.</q></p>
        <p>The President&rsquo;s statement is consistent with the White House spokespersons who have maintained that he intends to run but have not revealed timelines for a campaign.</p>
        <p>This is a tense and decisive moment for next year&rsquo;s upcoming election: former President Trump has announced a campaign, but faces a swath of legal issues including an indictment in New York, a federal investigation, and another ongoing investigation for election fraud in Georgia. Other prominent Republicans, such as Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy, have announced their candidacies, but early polling shows lackluster support for any other candidates besides Trump winning the GOP nomination.</p>
        <p>Biden himself is hardly in a better position: <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/06/politics/cnn-poll-biden-reelection-2024/index.html">CNN polling</a> published Thursday said just one-third of Americans believe Biden <q>deserves to be reelected</q> in 2024. Marianne Williamson and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have announced campaigns but seem, for now, to be long-shots.</p>

        <p><b>The Nashville Metropolitan Council</b>will meet Monday to reconsider reinstating Justin Jones, one of the two lawmakers expelled from the state legislature for their participation in gun control protests this past week. Ahead of the meeting, 23 of the 40 councilmembers have tweeted that they plan on voting for Jones&rsquo; reinstatement.</p>
        <p> A rally in support of Jones and the other members of the <q>Tennessee Three</q> will take place at the Metro Nashville Courthouse, marching to the State Capitol.</p>
        <p>Both Jones and former Rep. Justin Pearson, are seeking to reclaim their seats.</p>
