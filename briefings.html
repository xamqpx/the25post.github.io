        <p><b>Progressives secured</b> a long-awaited victory as the liberal judge won her election by an astounding 11% margin. Protasiewicz&rsquo;s win comes at a crucial time for reproductive rights; conservative justices up to this point had held a majority in the state supreme court, and upcoming rulings on Wisconsin&rsquo;s abortion law meant the future of abortion access had hinged on this election.</p>
        <p>Protasiewicz previously served at the Milwaukee County Circuit Court, to which she was elected as a judge in 2014 &mdash; and before that, she was a prosecutor in Milwaukee County with a focus on domestic abuse and other violent crimes.</p>

        <p><b>Tsai Ing-wen</b> made a brief visit in Simi Valley, meeting with the U.S. Speaker of the House in what the New York Times reported was <q>a carefully choreographed series of meetings.</q> The move was an apparent attempt to avoid furthering tensions in the Taiwan Strait &mdash; already made sour when Nancy Pelosi, McCarthy&rsquo;s predecessor, ignored threats of retaliation from China to visit the island.</p>
        <p>Though the visit was more tame than the promises of unabashed defiance McCarthy had made during the midterm elections, he told reporters after the meetings that a visit of his own to Taiwan was not off the table.</p>
        <p><q>I am the speaker of the House,</q> he said. <q>There is no place that China&rsquo;s going to tell me where I can go and who I can speak to, whether you be foe or whether you be friend.</q></p>
        <p>Tsai, who will continue a 10-day stint traveling to New York, Guatemala, and Belize, said the meeting would <q>reassure the people of Taiwan that we are not isolated and we are not alone.</q></p>

        <p><b>The Maryland attorney general's office</b> on Wednesday released its report, concluding a lengthy investigation into 80 years of abuse and coverup.</p>
        <p>The nearly 500-page report was the subject of intense legal battles over its release &mdash; until February, when a judge ordered a redacted version of the report be released, writing: <q>[The] only form of justice that may now be available is a public reckoning.</q></p>
        <p>These revelations come as ever frequent reports in recent years have brought systemic abuses in the Catholic Church to light. A 2019 CNN investigative report detailed harrowing accounts of abuse, by <q><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2019/12/us/salesians-of-don-bosco-intl/">pedophile priests</a></q> at a California school. Just across northern California, <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/clergy-abuse-scandal-investigation/3162757/">1,500 lawsuits against the Catholic Church</a> had been filed throughout the state's three-year lookback window, plaintiffs&rsquo; attorneys said.</p>
