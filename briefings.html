        <h2>Tennessee's House votes to expel two members for joining gun control protests</h2>

        <p><b>Two of three House members</b>, all Democrats, who joined gun control protests in the wake of the Nashville shooting, have been expelled from the legislature. Both members facing expulsion, Reps. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, are Black, while the third member &mdash; Rep. Gloria Johnson, who is white &mdash; narrowly stayed on in a vote almost strictly along party lines. The extraordinary move has some criticizing the Republican supermajority for acting in their political interest, unbeholden to the Democratic opposition and the will of the Tennesseean people.</p>
        <p>Jeff Greenfield for <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/04/06/tennessee-expulsion-future-democrats-00090911">Politico</a>:</p>
        <p class="quote">The case of the two Tennessee Democrats involves neither criminal nor immoral conduct nor the mere statement of opinions. It involves conduct &mdash; encouraging demonstrations and bringing a bullhorn and posters to the state House floor &mdash; that violates the rules of the House. Still, the legislature has never imposed before so severe a penalty for rules violations, and over the past few years, a number of legislators have kept their posts even after being charged with serious sexual misconduct.</p>

        <h2>ProPublica: Clarence Thomas failed to disclose luxury vacations with conservative donor</h2>

        <p><b>&ldquo;The extent and frequency</b> of [Harlan] Crow&rsquo;s apparent gifts to Thomas have no known precedent in the modern history of the U.S. Supreme Court,&rdquo; declared a ProPublica investigation, published Thursday.</p>
        <p>Thomas accompanied Crow, a prominent conservative donor and real estate billionaire, on trips to Indonesia, rides on his superyacht and his private jet, Crow's own ranch, and an exclusive all-male retreat in California, according to the report. Crow has insisted that he and his wife <q>have never sought to influence Justice Thomas on any legal or political issue,</q> but he has spent millions of dollars in shaping the judiciary and keeping his firm out of legal trouble, the report alleges.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers have called for stronger and better-enforced ethics standards for Supreme Court justices; but it remains doubtful whether such changes would be implemented, or if Thomas will be held accountable for his failure to disclose.</p>

        <h2>Israel launches airstrikes on Lebanon, Gaza</h2>
        <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/04/06/multimedia/06Israel-Lebanon-Gaza01-mjbk/06Israel-Lebanon-Gaza01-mjbk-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp">

        <p><b>The Israel Defense Forces</b> struck parts of southern Lebanon and Gaza, with Israeli authorities saying the strikes had targeted key locations for Hamas, the Palestinian militant group. The violence came mere hours after similar airstrikes from Lebanon into Israeli territory, in apparent retaliation for an Israeli police raid earlier this week of the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>The Israeli military, attributing the attacks on its territory to Hamas, targeted 10 sites in Gaza, including production sites, research and development sites, and tunnel infrastructure, Hamas said. The IDF, in turn, said it hit weapons manufacturing sites and <q>terror</q> tunnels.</p>
        <p>U.S. State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters Thursday evening that it <q>strongly</q> condemned Lebanon&rsquo;s attacks against Israel, and that Israel had the <q>legitimate right to defend itself against all forms of aggression.</q></p>
