        <p><b>The United States</b> officially declared the Wall Street Journal reporter <q>wrongly detained,</q> allowing the government access to a pool of resources previously unavailable, including the ability to pressure foreign governments and an extension of the State Department&rsquo;s ability to gather intelligence, exert media pressure, and form diplomatic coalitions.</p>
        <p>The speed at which the U.S. reached the designation &mdash; nearly two weeks since the news of his arrest first broke &mdash; was nearly unprecedented, officials said, as it usually takes months and only occurs after the detainee has met with U.S. consular officials, a right which Gershkovich has thus far been denied.</p>
        <p>Press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders said Gershkovich was reporting on Russian mercenary group Wagner in Yekaterinburg when he was arrested.</p>

        <h2>Nashville council votes to reinstate expelled Rep. Justin Jones</h2>

        <p><b>The Nashville Metro Council</b> voted unanimously Monday to reinstate one of the two former councilmembers ousted for their role in gun control protests on the Tennessee House floor.</p>
        <p><q>I want to welcome democracy back to the people's house,</q> Jones said in an address following the vote. <q>I want to thank you all, not for what you did, but for awakening the people of this state, particularly the young people. Thank you for reminding us that the struggle for justice is fought and won in every generation.</q></p>
        <p>Former Rep. Justin Pearson, who was expelled alongside Jones &mdash; both Black men &mdash; remains unseated. Rep. Gloria Johnson, the third member of the <q>Tennessee Three</q> for whom House Republicans had considered expulsion, narrowly survived her vote &mdash; a result she attributed to race. Pearson and Johnson joined supporters in the House chamber in cheering for Jones as he was reinstated.</p>

        <p><b>A coalition</b> of more than 400 pharmaceutical and biotech executives issued a <a href="https://docsend.com/view/2ahvmwy8djzxax3g">statement</a> Monday lambasting a federal judge&rsquo;s ruling that the Federal Drug Administration&rsquo;s approval of mifepistrone, the most commonly used medication for terminating a pregnancy, be halted.</p>
        <p><q>The decision ignores decades of scientific evidence and legal precedent,</q> the statement read. <q>Judge [Matthew] Karcsmaryk&rsquo;s act of judicial interference has set a precedent for diminishing FDA&rsquo;s authority over drug approvals, and in so doing, create suncertainty for the entire biopharma industry.</q></p>
        <p>Karcsmaryk allowed for a seven-day period in which the Justice Department could appeal. In its motion, the DOJ said <q>the court’s order would thwart F.D.A.’s scientific judgment and severely harm women, particularly those for whom mifepristone is a medical or practical necessity,</q> if Karcsmaryk&rsquo;s order were to take effect.</p>
        <p><q>This harm would be felt throughout the country, given that mifepristone has lawful uses in every state,</q> the motion read.</p>
