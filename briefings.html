        <h2>Texas judge rules FDA mifepistrone approval should be halted</h2>

        <p><b>A preliminary ruling</b> from a federal judge suspended the Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s approval of mifepistrone, a prescription medication commonly used for abortions.</p>
        <p>If enacted, the suspension could threaten abortion access regardless of state &mdash; even in states like California with otherwise robust protections for reproductive rights.</p>
        <p>The ruling, by U.S. District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryck,is the culmination of a high-profile case brought forth by the conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, who invoked 19th century anti-obscentiy laws to argue that the FDA had overstepped its authority in approving mifepistrone in 2000. Kacsmaryck has delayed the effect of the decision by one week, allowing the Justice Department to appeal.</p>

        <p><b>Yemen government officials</b> were in Saudi Arabia Thursday to discuss a three-year plan to end the brutal and prolonged civil war in the country.</p>
        <p>The proposed plan would take place in three stages, a diplomat said. The first phase would be a <q>six-month truce between warring factions in Yemen,</q> making space for efforts to <q>rebuild trust and lay the groundwork for peace.</q> The second stage would be a dialogue addressing grievances among the factions and reopening closed roads and ports. The third would be an establishment of a new Yemeni government.</p>
        <p>A truce between the Yemeni government and the Houthi, an Islamist anti-imperialist rebel faction, is likely to take place shortly, the diplomat said.</p>
        <p>The civil war, ongoing since 2014, began as a Houthi insurgence against the Sunni government, but soon became what many consider a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.</p>
