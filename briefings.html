        <h2>Russia announces espionage charges against Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich</h2>
        <img src="https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1280,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/08/GettyImages-1249927979-scaled.jpg">

        <p><b>Russian state news outlets</b> reported Friday that Gershkovich was formally charged for espionage &mdash; an allegation he has denied &mdash; indicating the start of a criminal probe by a country whose charges brought against journalists are rarely overturned in court.</p>
        <p>Gershkovich is the first U.S. journalist to be detained on espionage charges by Russia since the Cold War.</p>
        <p>The news comes as a rare bipartisan statement Friday from the United States &mdash; by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell &mdash; demanded Russia release Gershkovich immediately, praising him as a <q>â€œinternationally known and respected independent journalist.</q></p>
        <p>The FSB, Russia&rsquo;s security agency, has claimed Gershkovich <q>was caught red-handed while trying to obtain secret information, using his journalistic status as a cover for illegal actions.</q> </p>

        <h2>More U.S. classified documents leaked on social media</h2>

        <p><b>More than 100 documents</b>  containing sensitive information about U.S. national security secrets on Ukraine, the Middle East and China, appeared on social media sites Friday, officials said. This comes just one day after a similar batch of documents pertaining to U.S. and NATO plans for the Russian invasion of Ukraine surfaced on Twitter and Telegram Thursday.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon, having acknowledged the authenticity of the documents, is scrambling to scrub them from the sites &mdash; attempts at which are proving largely unsuccessful. The Justice Department said it is investigating the matter.</p>
        <p>Documents include photographs of charts of anticipated weapons deliveries, troop and battalion strengths, and other plans, the New York Times reported. Some documents, however, appear to have been altered in part, with U.S. estimates of Ukrainian war casualties overstated and estimates of Russian troops kittled understated.</p>
        <p><q>As many of these were pictures of documents, it appears that it was a deliberate leak done by someone that wished to damage the Ukraine, U.S., and NATO efforts,</q> said Mick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official.</p>

        <h2>Gov. Gavin Newsom walks back pledge to stop doing business with Walgreens</h2>

        <p><b>The governor's office</b> said Friday that it would continue its business with the pharmacy chain, as legal experts told the Los Angeles Times that the state is bound to do so by federal law.</p>
        <p>Newsom had announced in March that it would halt the renewal of Walgreens&rsquo; contract, taking issue with the chain&rsquo;s decision to not sell mifepristone in states cracking down on abortion. But law pertaining to the Medi-Cal program, through which California pays Walgreens, dictates that eligible patients can pick up their medications at any approved pharmacy.</p>
        <p><q>California has no intention of taking any action that would violate federal Medicaid requirements, or that could undermine access for low-income individuals,</q> a spokesperson for the governor wrote in a statement to the L.A. Times. Another spokesperson said that <q>tweeting is not policy,</q> and that Newsom would not <q>take any action that hurts people who need access to care.</q></p>
