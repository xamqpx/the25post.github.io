                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretty much immediately after the attack, the Israeli government declared war against Hamas. Netanyahu&rsquo;s first order was to lay complete siege to Gaza, denying the region any food, water, electricity or aid. The Israel Defense Forces also began mobilizing for a ground invasion, even though many experts, as well as the U.S. government, doubted whether that would actually be effective in achieving the stated objective of eliminating Hamas.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been difficult to know a lot of the details of Israel&rsquo;s ongoing offensive against Gaza. From what little we do know &mdash; based on what has managed to come out of the region amid constant internet blackouts &mdash; </span></p>

                <p>&mdash; Israeli airstrikes have targeted hospitals, schools, ambulances, residential areas, refugee camps, and shelters run by the United Nations.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The death toll in Gaza has already climbed to 10,000 people as of a few days ago, and shows no sign of stopping. More than 3,600 of them were children.</p>

                <p>Many outlets have been quick to point out that the health ministry in Gaza, which reports these numbers, is run by Hamas, and doesn&rsquo;t distinguish between militants and civilians when publishing these numbers. Some have even questioned whether the numbers were even accurate. But in similar conflicts over the years, independent counts by Human Rights Watch and the United Nations have supported the ministry&rsquo;s own counts. The Israel and Palestine director of Human Rights Watch, Omar Shakir, has said: <strong>QUOTE</strong>&ldquo;THESE FIGURES ARE PROFESSIONALLY DONE AND HAVE PROVEN TO BE RELIABLE.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>The sheer number of Palestinians killed, if nothing else, has caused many experts, including at the United Nations, to decry Israel&rsquo;s attack on Gaza as a genocide. On November 2nd, UN experts released a statement, calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza as Palestinians faced a &ldquo;grave risk of genocide.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Days before that, on Oct. 28, Craig Mokhiber, director of the New York office of the UN high commissioner for human rights, resigned, writing: <strong>QUOTE</strong>&ldquo;ONCE AGAIN, WE ARE SEEING A GENOCIDE UNFOLDING BEFORE OUR EYES, AND THE ORGANIZATION THAT WE SERVE APPEARS POWERLESS TO STOP IT.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, the use of the term &ldquo;genocide&rdquo; has been a significant controversy in the United States, which has been a steadfast ally of Israel since the state&rsquo;s inception in 1948. College students and other Americans who lean harder to the left have more openly embraced the term, while a majority of elected officials, public figures, and American companies have been more vague &mdash; either explicitly siding with Israel or issuing vague statements of sympathy for civilians in both Israel and Gaza. The only Palestinian American lawmaker in Congress, Rashida Tlaib, was just censured by the House of Representatives for &ldquo;promoting false narratives&rdquo; and &ldquo;calling for the destruction of the state of Israel.&rdquo; (This was after Tlaib had used the slogan &ldquo;from the river to the sea&rdquo; on social media while advocating for Palestinian liberation; she also drew bipartisan ire after she urged President Biden to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, saying he was supporting the &ldquo;genocide of the Palestinian people.&rdquo;)</p>
