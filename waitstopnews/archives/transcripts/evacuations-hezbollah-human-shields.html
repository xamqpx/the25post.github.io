                <p>=== NORTHERN GAZA EVACUATIONS ===</p>
                <p>On Oct. 13, Israel ordered more than 1 million people living in the northern part of Gaza to flee to the south within 24 hours in advance of an expected ground invasion of Gaza. Hamas in response called on Palestinians to reject the order and stay put, causing even more confusion. Of course, as we know now, the ground invasion didn&rsquo;t start until a few days later, but the order was nonetheless met with an outcry from human rights organizations and even the World Health Organization saying, <strong>QUOTE</strong>&ldquo;A MASS EVACUATION WOULD BE DISASTROUS&mdash;FOR PATIENTS, HEALTH WORKERS AND OTHER CIVILIANS LEFT BEHIND OR CAUGHT IN THE MASS MOVEMENT.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The WHO especially noted that <strong>QUOTE</strong>&ldquo;IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EVACUATE VULNERABLE HOSPITAL PATIENTS WITHOUT ENDANGERING THEIR LIVES. VULNERABLE PATIENTS INCLUDE THOSE WHO ARE CRITICALLY INJURED OR DEPENDENT ON LIFE SUPPORT. MOVING THEM AMID HOSTILITIES PUTS THEIR LIVES AT IMMEDIATE RISK.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>=== HEZBOLLAH INVOLVEMENT ===</p>
                <p>I mentioned in an earlier video that Hamas hoped, at least according to one of its media advisers, that <strong>QUOTE</strong>&ldquo;THE STATE OF WAR WITH ISRAEL WILL BECOME PERMANENT ON ALL THE BORDERS, AND THAT THE ARAB WORLD WILL STAND WITH US.&rdquo; And in some sense, that has been true. Hezbollah, a Lebanese militia, and some other Iran-backed groups have been launching attacks against Israel and other bases throughout the Middle East where American soldiers are known to be stationed. Among those groups, though, Hezbollah has been the most involved. There isn&rsquo;t really any formal sense of war: Hezbollah&rsquo;s deputy secretary general, Naim Qassem, told CBS News that the group <strong>QUOTE</strong>&ldquo;PARTICIPATES FOR THE SAKE OF LOWERING THE PRESSURE ON GAZA,&rdquo; as opposed to a full scale war against Israel. What we&rsquo;ve seen between Hezbollah and Israel corroborates this as well; the same CBS News report writes that the back and forth airstrikes between Israel and Lebanon seem to indicate <strong>QUOTE</strong>&ldquo;repeated harassment or tit-for-tat attacks rather than uncontrollable conflict.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>=== HAMAS HUMAN SHIELDS ===</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-november-10-2023/" target="_blank">https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-november-10-2023/</a></p>
                <p>Israel has consistently defended its military actions in Gaza, even as they have killed more than 11,000 people in the region as of today, saying that it never intends to attack civilians, only Hamas. It has also accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, by using hospitals and schools as operating bases, and therefore argues that it is justified in striking those locations.. But this hasn&rsquo;t stopped human rights organizations from condemning Israeli airstrikes on those areas.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><a href="https://twitter.com/hrw/status/1722659783574958118" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/hrw/status/1722659783574958118</a></p>
                <p>Just yesterday, for example, Human Rights Watch posted a long thread on X, formerly Twitter, expressing concern about Israeli forces encircling Al Shifa Hospital, saying: <strong>QUOTE</strong>&ldquo;HOSPITALS HAVE SPECIAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAWS OF WAR, WHICH THEY ONLY LOSE IF THEY ARE BEING USED TO COMMIT &ldquo;ACTS HARMFUL TO THE ENEMY&rdquo; AND AFTER DUE WARNING. EVACUATION OF HOSPITAL PATIENTS AND STAFF SHOULD ONLY BE A LAST RESORT.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Israel did order an evacuation, but the roads through which patients and staff could evacuate were engulfed in fire or surrounded by armored vehicles, neither of which constitute safe passages.</p>
                <p>Human Rights Watch writes: <strong>QUOTE</strong>&ldquo;ISRAEL&rsquo;S EVACUATION ORDERS RAISE GRAVE CONCERNS. WARRING PARTIES SHOULD ISSUE EFFECTIVE WARNINGS WHEN CONDITIONS PERMIT. BUT CALLS SUGGESTING ALL CIVILIAN STRUCTURES ARE TARGETS OR ALERTING CIVILIANS TO FLEE WITHOUT A SAFE PASSAGE OR SAFE PLACE TO GO DOES NOT SUFFICE.&rdquo;</p>
