                <p><span class="padded-dropcap">O</span>n Oct. 7, Hamas launched a surprise attack against Israel at an almost unprecedented scale. Militants were breaking through the border fence between Gaza and Israel at at least six different locations, even paragliding over them.</p>
                <p>They descended on kibbutzim, or villages, near the Israel-Gaza border; they descended on a music festival; they raided Israeli military camps. Once on the ground they targeted civilians indiscriminately, killing more than 1,400 total, making Oct. 7 the single deadliest day in Israel since its formation.</p>
                <p>The nature of some of the killings is unclear. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed babies were found decapitated, and that claim has since spread far and wide; but the evidence for it is sparse and most outlets that initially reported it have since walked back those reports. Even President Joe Biden claimed that he had seen pictures of beheaded children, but the White House later walked that back as well. (<a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2023/10/12/40-israeli-babies-beheaded-by-hamas/" target="_blank">Snopes</a> has a good rundown of this.)</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, at least 200 people have also been dragged back to Gaza as hostages. Initial reports had the number anywhere between 200 to 299, but many outlets seemed to have since settled at 239 or 240. (The Israeli outlet Haaretz has a <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-22/ty-article-magazine/hostages-held-by-hamas-the-names-of-those-abducted-from-israel/0000018b-55f8-d5d2-afef-d5fdd04e0000" target="_blank">list of people</a> confirmed to have been abducted. You may have seen some of these names on posters plastered throughout the country, which we&rsquo;ll get to in a second.)</p>
                <p>A <em>New York Times</em> piece that was just published offers the clearest indication of Hamas&rsquo; intentions for attacking Israel. It features weeks&rsquo; worth of interviews with Hamas leaders, who say that with the Oct. 7 attack, they have &ldquo;succeeded in putting the Palestinian issue back on the table.&rdquo; Hamas leaders were also quite aware that Israel&rsquo;s retaliation against Gaza would be disproportionate and devastating &mdash; but it was part of the plan: a Hamas media adviser told the <em>Times </em>that they hoped &ldquo;the state of war with Israel will become permanent on all the borders, and that the Arab world will stand with us.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>As for the hostages, Hamas&rsquo;s motivation to take hostages seems to have been to leverage them for a deal to swap them out for Palestinian prisoners in Israel. This was a tactic that worked much to Hamas&rsquo;s benefit in the past: in 2011, Israel released more than 1,000 prisoners in exchange for one Israeli soldier. But the original intent was to take Israeli soldiers, not civilians, according to the <em>Times </em>piece.</p>
                <p>Why Hamas decided to also target civilians, in what human rights organizations have described as violations of international law, is something even Hamas leaders are still struggling to justify.</p>
                <p>I&rsquo;d encourage you to read this <em>New York Times</em> piece in full for context.</p>
